## 🚀 DEPLOY TO NETLIFY (10 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Create Netlify Account (2 min)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/signup
2. Click "Sign up with GitHub"
3. Authorize Netlify to access your repos

### Step 2: Connect Repository (3 min)
1. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
2. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
3. Select your repository: `TheAccidentalTeacher/maps`
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Branch to deploy:** `main`
   - **Build command:** (leave blank)
   - **Publish directory:** `.` (root)
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Wait for Build (2 min)
- Netlify will build and deploy automatically
- You'll get a random URL like: `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`
- Takes ~1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Test Your Site (2 min)
1. Click the generated URL
2. Test each game mode:
   - ✅ Explore Mode (should work 100%)
   - ✅ Mystery Challenge (should work)
   - ✅ Guess Mode (should auto-advance!)
   - ✅ Alaska Adventure (should work)
   - ⚠️ AI Facts/Photos/Weather (will show "Deploy to see this feature")

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables (1 min)
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings"
2. Click "Environment variables"
3. Add these variables:
   - `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` = (get from https://openweathermap.org/api - free tier!)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = (optional, for AI Facts)
4. Click "Deploy site" to rebuild with new vars

---

## 🎯 CUSTOM DOMAIN (OPTIONAL)

### If you own a domain (e.g., geographydetective.com):

1. In Netlify, go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain: `geographydetective.com`
4. Follow DNS instructions to point domain to Netlify
5. SSL certificate will be automatically generated

**Result:** Students access at your custom domain instead of `*.netlify.app`

---

## 🌍 DEPLOY TO GITHUB PAGES (5 MINUTES)

### Quick Deploy (No Functions)

1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/TheAccidentalTeacher/maps
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/` (root)
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Your site will be live at: `https://theaccidentalteacher.github.io/maps/`

**Note:** AI Facts, Photos, and Weather cards won't work (they need Netlify Functions), but the rest works perfectly!

## 📊 WHAT STUDENTS WILL SEE

### Working Features (No Setup Required):
- ✅ **Free Explore Mode** - Click anywhere, see Location Explorer
- ✅ **Mystery Challenge** - 75 locations, timer, scoring
- ✅ **Guess Mode** - Auto-advancing photo quiz
- ✅ **Alaska Adventure** - Find all Alaska locations
- ✅ **Create Heist** - Design your own treasure hunt
- ✅ **Achievements** - 45 achievements, XP system
- ✅ **Gen Alpha Mode** - Purple theme, slang mode

### Needs Environment Variables:

- ⚠️ **Photos Card** - Works with free APIs (Unsplash/Pexels)
- ⚠️ **Weather Card** - Needs OPENWEATHER_API_KEY (free tier)

**Bottom Line:** App is 95% functional on free deployment, 100% with free API keys!

### OpenWeatherMap (For Weather Card)
1. Sign up: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Choose "Free Plan" (60 calls/minute = plenty!)

5. **Cost:** $0/month

### Unsplash (For Photos - OPTIONAL)
1. Sign up: https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Create new app

## 🔐 NEXT STEP: ADD STUDENT LOGINS

1. Simple username login (3 hours to build)
2. Per-student progress tracking
3. Works on shared Chromebooks
4. No cloud sync needed initially

**See:** `STUDENT_AUTH_PLAN.md` for complete guide
