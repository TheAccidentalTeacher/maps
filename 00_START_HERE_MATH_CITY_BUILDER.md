## 🚨 MANDATORY READING FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**If you're working on Math City Builder, you MUST read these documents IN ORDER:**

1. **This file** (you're reading it now) - Overview and quick start
2. 👉 **[MATH_CITY_BUILDER_ACTUAL_STATUS.md](./MATH_CITY_BUILDER_ACTUAL_STATUS.md)** ⭐ REQUIRED - Detailed technical status
3. 👉 **[MATH_CITY_BUILDER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./MATH_CITY_BUILDER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - One-page cheat sheet
4. 👉 **[WORKSPACE_MASTER_INDEX.md](./WORKSPACE_MASTER_INDEX.md)** - Full navigation (Math City Builder section)
5. 👉 **[GAME_ENGINE_EVALUATION_SUMMARY.md](./GAME_ENGINE_EVALUATION_SUMMARY.md)** - History of all engine attempts

**CRITICAL:** Also read the main workspace guide:
👉 **[00_START_HERE_FIRST.md](./00_START_HERE_FIRST.md)** - Main entry point for entire workspace

---

## ⚠️ DOCUMENTS TO IGNORE (OUTDATED!)

**DO NOT READ THESE - They contain wrong information:**
- ❌ **GDEVELOP_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** - WRONG! We never used GDevelop
- ❌ **CONSTRUCT3_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** - ARCHIVED - Project failed, refund requested

These files are kept for historical reference only but do NOT reflect current reality.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST!

If you're an AI assistant or returning to this project after time away:

### The Actual Truth:

1. **We NEVER used GDevelop** (despite docs saying we did)
2. **We have a WORKING 2D Canvas game** built October 26, 2025, 9:37 PM
3. **Location:** `math-city-builder/` folder (NOT `math-city-builder.html`)
4. **It's 60% complete** - needs sprite assets and testing
5. **DO NOT read GDEVELOP_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** - it's wrong!

## ⚠️ What's Missing (40%)

### 🚨 BLOCKER: Sprite Assets
**Problem:** Code expects PNG files, we have GLB models

**Current broken path:**
```
../assets/math-city-builder/buildings/tier1/house-small.png
```

**Quick Fix (2 hours):**
```javascript
// Use emoji placeholders
const emojiSprites = {
    tier1: '🏠',
    tier2: '🏢',
    tier3: '🏭',
    tier4: '🌆',
    tier5: '🗼'
};
```

### Need Testing:
- [ ] Quiz modal (button exists, needs verification)
- [ ] Building placement (logic exists, needs testing)
- [ ] Money deduction on purchase
- [ ] City value calculations
- [ ] Supabase integration (uses localStorage only)

---

## 🎯 To Finish (8-12 Hours)

### Step 1: Get Sprites Working (2-4 hours)
**Option A - Emoji (Fastest):**
1. Open `js/canvas.js`
2. Replace `ctx.drawImage()` with emoji rendering
3. Test immediately

**Option B - Convert GLB → PNG (4 hours):**
1. Open Blender
2. Batch export GLB files as PNG (top-down view)
3. Save to `assets/math-city-builder/buildings/tier{X}/`
4. Update paths in `canvas.js`

### Step 2: Test Everything (2 hours)
1. Open: http://localhost:8000/math-city-builder/index.html
2. Test building placement
3. Test quiz modal
4. Fix any bugs found

### Step 3: Add Supabase (4 hours)
1. Copy auth code from old `math-city-builder.html`
2. Add cloud save to `city_progress` table
3. Replace localStorage calls
4. Test save/load

### Step 4: Polish (2 hours)
1. Add animations
2. Sound effects
3. Better visual feedback
4. Mobile responsiveness

---

## 🔄 Why The Confusion?

### Timeline:

**Oct 25 (Morning):**
- Construct 3 failed ($168 refund requested)
- Created GDevelop account
- Documented "GDevelop is the plan"

**Oct 25 (Afternoon):**
- Built `math-city-builder.html` (Three.js, 923 lines)
- Got stuck on rendering
- Left it as "failed"

**Oct 26 (Evening - 9:37 PM):**
- **Built the actual working game!**
- Created `math-city-builder/` folder
- Modular JavaScript architecture
- 2D Canvas with sprites
- **Did NOT update documentation!** 😱

**Oct 27 (Morning):**
- AI read old docs, said "nothing done"
- User: "We did 12 hours yesterday!"
- Found working game in separate folder
- Created this guide

---

## 💡 Key Lessons

1. **Update docs immediately** - Don't wait
2. **One main implementation** - Not multiple versions
3. **Clear file naming** - `folder/` vs `file.html` caused confusion
4. **Test as you build** - Don't assume it works
5. **Archive old attempts** - Mark them clearly

---

## 🎮 Next Session Checklist

- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test building placement
- [ ] Test quiz modal
- [ ] Choose sprite solution (emoji vs. convert GLB)
- [ ] Update this file with progress
