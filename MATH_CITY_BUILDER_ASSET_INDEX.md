- `SE` = Southeast (diagonal down-right)
- `SW` = Southwest (diagonal down-left)

**Elevation Codes:**
- `NEU` = Northeast going uphill
- `NED` = Northeast going downhill
- `NWU` = Northwest going uphill
- `NWD` = Northwest going downhill
- `SEU` = Southeast going uphill

### Integration Strategy

**Passive Animation System (v1.0):**
- Random civilian cars appear on roads every 10 seconds
- Cars "drive" along road tiles (move 1 tile per second)
- Cars despawn at edge of map
- Purely visual, no interaction

**Advanced Traffic System (v2.0):**
- Emergency vehicles appear during special events
- Police car: "Law & Order" achievement - city reaches 50 buildings
- Ambulance: "Healthcare City" achievement - place hospital building
- Garbage truck: "Clean Streets" achievement - no trash on roads
- Traffic density increases with city size

**Animation Logic:**
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for vehicle animation
function spawnVehicle() {
    const vehicle = {
        sprite: 'Civilian/Blue/Sedan1/sedan1_E.png',
        x: 0,
        y: randomRoadTile(),
        direction: 'E',
        speed: 1 // tile per second
    };
    
    vehicles.push(vehicle);
}

function updateVehicles(deltaTime) {
    vehicles.forEach(vehicle => {
        vehicle.x += vehicle.speed * deltaTime;
        
        // Change sprite based on direction
        const orientation = getOrientation(vehicle.direction);
        vehicle.sprite = updateSprite(vehicle.type, orientation);
        
        // Remove if off-screen
        if (vehicle.x > GRID_WIDTH) {
            vehicles.splice(vehicles.indexOf(vehicle), 1);
        }
    });
}
```

**Student Engagement:**
- "Busy City" achievement: 10 vehicles on screen at once (+$150)
- "Traffic Jam" easter egg: 20+ vehicles spawn if city has 100 buildings

## Asset Loading Strategy

### Progressive Loading System

**Initial Load (Required):**
```javascript
// Load only what's needed for first screen
const INITIAL_ASSETS = [
    'grass.png', // Background tile
    ...TIER_1_BUILDINGS, // First 5 buildings (000-020)
    'ui-panel.png', // UI elements
    'icon-coin.png',
    'icon-xp.png'
];
```

**Lazy Load (Load on demand):**
```javascript
// Load when tier unlocks
function unlockTier(tier) {
    const tierAssets = BUILDING_TIERS[`tier${tier}`];
    preloadAssets(tierAssets);
}

// Load when feature accessed
function enableDecorations() {
    const decorationAssets = [...TREES, ...LIGHTS, ...BENCHES];
    preloadAssets(decorationAssets);
}
```

**Spritesheet Optimization (Future):**
```
// Instead of 129 individual files
buildingTiles_000.png (50 KB) × 129 = 6.45 MB

// Use single spritesheet
buildingTiles_spritesheet.png = 2 MB (compressed)
buildingTiles_data.json = 5 KB (coordinates)
```
