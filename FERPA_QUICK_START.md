**For:** Alaska Middle School Teacher deploying to 15 students  
**Goal:** 100% FERPA-compliant SaaS application  
**Reading Time:** 5 minutes

## ‚ö° TL;DR - What You Need to Know

### What is FERPA?
**FERPA = Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act**  
It's a federal law that protects student education records. If you're using this app in schools, you MUST comply.

### Does This Apply to You?
‚úÖ **YES** if:
- You're a teacher using this in your classroom
- You're storing student progress data
- You're selling this to schools
- You're building a SaaS for educators

‚ùå **NO** if:
- Parents are using it at home with their own kids (COPPA applies instead)

### What Data is Protected?
**Everything about student performance:**
- ‚úÖ Student names and usernames
- ‚úÖ Game progress and scores
- ‚úÖ Achievement data
- ‚úÖ Play time logs
- ‚úÖ Quiz answers
- ‚úÖ Any performance metrics

## üö® Critical FERPA Requirements

### 1. Parental Rights (The Big 4)
Parents have the right to:
1. **Inspect** - See all their child's data
2. **Correct** - Request changes to inaccurate records
3. **Control** - Approve who sees the data
4. **Delete** - Remove their child's account entirely

**Your Action:** Build these 4 features into your parent dashboard.

---

### 2. Legal Agreements Required

#### A. School Service Agreement
**What:** Contract between you and the school  
**Must Include:**
- You'll only use data for education (not ads/marketing)
- You won't share data with third parties
- You'll maintain security (encryption)
- You'll delete data when requested
- You'll notify school of breaches within 48 hours

**Template:** See FERPA_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md Section 9

#### B. Privacy Policy
**What:** Public document explaining data practices  
**Must Include:**
- What data you collect (and why)
- How you protect it
- Parent rights
- How to delete data
- Third-party services you use

**Template:** See FERPA_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md Section 9

---

### 3. Technical Security Controls

#### A. Encryption (Required)
```
‚úÖ Data at rest: AES-256 (Supabase provides this)
‚úÖ Data in transit: TLS 1.3 (Netlify provides this)
‚úÖ Database backups: Encrypted (Supabase provides this)
```
**Your Action:** Use Supabase + Netlify = automatic compliance ‚úÖ

#### B. Access Control (Required)
```sql
-- Students can ONLY see their own data
-- Teachers can ONLY see their classroom
-- Parents can ONLY see their children
```
**Your Action:** Implement Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase  
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Guide:** See SAAS_IMPLEMENTATION_READY.md lines 450-550

#### C. Audit Logging (Required)
```sql
-- Track WHO accessed WHAT data WHEN
-- Required for compliance investigations
```
**Your Action:** Create `ferpa_audit_log` table  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Code:** See FERPA_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md Section 6D

### 4. Data Minimization (Best Practice)

#### ‚úÖ DO Collect:
- Student name/username (identification)
- Age/grade (appropriate content)
- Game progress (educational assessment)
- Scores (performance tracking)

#### ‚ùå DON'T Collect:
- Email addresses (not needed)
- Home addresses (not needed)
- Phone numbers (not needed)
- Photos/videos (not needed)
- Social media (not needed)

**Bottom Line:** Only collect what's necessary for education.

### 5. Data Retention (Required Policy)

| Data Type | Keep For | Then What? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Active students | While enrolled + 1 year | Auto-delete |
| Graduated students | 3 years after graduation | Archive then delete |
| Deleted accounts | 90 days (recovery period) | Permanent deletion |
| Audit logs | 7 years | Legal requirement |

**Your Action:** Implement automated cleanup job  
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Code:** See FERPA_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md Section 7

---

### 6. Third-Party Services (Subprocessors)

You need written agreements with ANY service that handles student data:

| Service | Has Student Data? | Need Agreement? | Status |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Supabase | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | Sign BAA |
| Netlify | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | Review ToS |
| Stripe | ‚ùå NO (billing only) | ‚ùå NO | N/A |
| OpenAI | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE | ‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK | Review API calls |

**Your Action:**
