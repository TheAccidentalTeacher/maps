## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log:

**Oct 16, 2025 - Achievement System Architecture:**
- **localStorage over backend:** Zero friction, no login required
- **Set-based tracking:** Automatic deduplication for continents, layers, photos
- **Tier-based XP:** Common (50-75), Uncommon (100-150), Rare (200-250), Epic (300-400), Legendary (500-1000)
- **Total possible XP:** ~11,000 across all 45 achievements
- **Save triggers:** Every unlock, XP gain, stat update
- **Load trigger:** DOMContentLoaded event

**Oct 16, 2025 - Starting with achievements because:**
- Already have proven pattern from Alaska Adventure
- Highest engagement impact
- Can be incrementally added to each game
- Foundation for other features
