## 📋 What's Next? (Your Vision!)

### Phase 2: Mix Real + AI-Generated Images 🎨

**Your Idea:** Mix Unsplash photos with AI-generated images

**How We'll Do It:**
```javascript
// For each location:
1. Get 2 real photos from Unsplash (specific landmarks)
2. Generate 2 AI images with DALL-E 3:
   - "Photorealistic aerial view of [location]"
   - "Educational diagram showing [geographic feature]"
3. Mix them in the grid!
```

**Cost:**
- DALL-E 3: $0.04 per image
- 2 AI images per location = $0.08
- Total with all features: ~$0.08 per location
- For 2,000 locations: **~$160/month**

**Safety:** Always watermark AI images, label them clearly

### Phase 3: Context-Driven Image Generation 🧠

**Your BRILLIANT Idea:**
```
AI Facts → Extract key concepts → Generate specific images
```

Example for Khandiga, Yakutsk, Russia:
1. **AI Facts generate:** "Permafrost region, diamond mining, indigenous Sakha culture"
2. **System extracts concepts:** Permafrost, diamonds, Sakha people
3. **AI generates 4 images:**
   - "Photorealistic permafrost landscape in Yakutia"
   - "Traditional Sakha dwelling in winter"
   - "Diamond mining operation in Siberia"  
   - "Indigenous Sakha person in traditional clothing"

**This is GENIUS!** Facts inform the images! 🔥

### Phase 4: Image Quality Scoring 🎯

Add relevance AI to score each image:
```javascript
// Rate each image 1-10 for educational value
if (score < 7) {
    // Generate AI replacement
    replaceWithAIImage(concepts);
}
```

## 🔒 Safety Measures (Always!)

✅ **Photo Sources:**
- Unsplash: Professional, curated
- Pexels: Safe, verified
- AI-generated: Always labeled

✅ **Caption Safety:**
- Age-appropriate language
- Factually accurate
- No politics/violence
