# üõ°Ô∏è FERPA COMPLIANCE GUIDE - Geographic Detective Academy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025  
**Regulation:** Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) - 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 1232g  
**Status:** Production-ready compliance framework

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is FERPA?
FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Any educational technology used in schools must comply with FERPA regulations.

### FERPA Requirements for EdTech
1. **Parental Consent** - Parents must consent to data collection
2. **Limited Data Collection** - Collect only what's needed for education
3. **Secure Storage** - Protect student data with encryption
4. **Access Control** - Only authorized users can view student records
5. **Data Retention** - Delete data when no longer needed
6. **Third-Party Agreements** - Vendors must sign FERPA compliance agreements
7. **Breach Notification** - Report data breaches within required timeframes
8. **Audit Trails** - Track who accesses student data

### Your Current Status
- ‚úÖ **localStorage only** - No server-side student data currently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SaaS requires compliance** - Must implement FERPA controls before school deployment
- ‚úÖ **Architecture supports FERPA** - Supabase + Row Level Security = compliant

---

## üéØ FERPA COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Education Records (Covered by FERPA)

#### What Geographic Detective Academy Stores:
| Data Type | FERPA Protected? | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Student name | ‚úÖ YES | Personally identifiable |
| Username | ‚úÖ YES | Can identify student |
| Age/Grade | ‚úÖ YES | Educational context |
| Game progress | ‚úÖ YES | Educational performance data |
| Achievement scores | ‚úÖ YES | Academic performance indicator |
| Play time/session logs | ‚úÖ YES | Attendance/engagement record |
| XP/scores | ‚úÖ YES | Grading/assessment data |
| Geography quiz answers | ‚úÖ YES | Test results |
| Teacher notes | ‚úÖ YES | Educational assessments |

#### What is NOT Protected:
- ‚ùå Directory information (if publicly available)
- ‚ùå De-identified data (no way to identify student)
- ‚ùå Publicly available information

**Bottom Line:** Almost everything in your app is FERPA-protected education records.

---

### 2. Parental Rights Under FERPA

Parents have the right to:
1. **Inspect and review** their child's education records
2. **Request corrections** to inaccurate records
3. **Control disclosure** of personally identifiable information
4. **File complaints** with the Department of Education

#### Your Implementation:
```javascript
// Parent Dashboard - FERPA Required Features
const parentDashboard = {
  // 1. View all child data
  viewChildData: async (parentId, childId) => {
    // Show: game progress, achievements, play time, quiz results
    const data = await fetchAllChildData(childId);
    return data; // Full transparency
  },
  
  // 2. Export all child data (FERPA right to inspect)
  exportChildData: async (childId) => {
    const data = await fetchAllChildData(childId);
    return downloadJSON(data, `child_data_${childId}.json`);
  },
  
  // 3. Request data correction
  requestCorrection: async (childId, field, newValue, reason) => {
    await submitCorrectionRequest({
      childId,
      field,
      newValue,
      reason,
      status: 'pending'
    });
    // Teacher reviews and approves
  },
  
  // 4. Delete all child data (right to control disclosure)
  deleteChildAccount: async (childId) => {
    // PERMANENTLY delete all records
    await cascadeDelete(childId); // Removes from all tables
    await auditLog('FERPA_DELETION', { childId, timestamp: Date.now() });
  }
};
```

---

### 3. School Official Exception

#### When Can Teachers Access Student Data?
FERPA allows "school officials" to access student records if they have a "legitimate educational interest."

**Your app qualifies because:**
- ‚úÖ Teacher is a school official
- ‚úÖ Purpose is education (geography learning)
- ‚úÖ Access is necessary to perform instructional duties
- ‚úÖ School has written agreement with you (vendor)

#### Required Written Agreement:
Schools must have a **FERPA Compliance Agreement** with you stating:
1. You will use student data ONLY for educational purposes
2. You will not re-disclose data without consent
3. You will maintain security standards
4. You will delete data when no longer needed
5. You will allow parents to inspect records

---

### 4. Data Minimization

**FERPA Best Practice:** Collect only what's necessary for education.

#### What You NEED to Collect:
- ‚úÖ Student name or username (identification)
- ‚úÖ Age/grade (appropriate content)
- ‚úÖ Game progress (educational assessment)
- ‚úÖ Achievement data (learning outcomes)
- ‚úÖ Play time (engagement tracking)

#### What You DON'T NEED:
- ‚ùå Email address (teacher has it)
- ‚ùå Phone number (not needed)
- ‚ùå Home address (not needed)
- ‚ùå Parent names (teacher has it)
- ‚ùå Social media profiles (not needed)
- ‚ùå Photo/video of student (not needed)
- ‚ùå Biometric data (not needed)

**Your Current Architecture:** Already complies! You don't collect unnecessary data.

---

### 5. Consent Requirements

#### Classroom/School Scenario (FERPA applies)
**Consent Pathway:**
1. School signs FERPA agreement with you (vendor)
2. School obtains parent consent (or uses school official exception)
3. Teacher creates student accounts
4. Students use app at school
5. Parents can access data via teacher

**No direct parent consent needed** if:
- ‚úÖ School has agreement with you
- ‚úÖ Teacher is creating accounts (school official)
- ‚úÖ Use is for educational purposes
- ‚úÖ Parents are notified and can opt-out

#### Family/Home Scenario (FERPA does NOT apply)
**Consent Pathway:**
1. Parent creates account
2. Parent adds child profiles
3. Parent is the consent provider
4. COPPA applies instead of FERPA

---

### 6. Security Requirements

FERPA requires "reasonable" security measures to protect student data.

#### Required Security Controls:

**A. Encryption**
```javascript
// Supabase provides encryption by default
// - Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
// - Data in transit: TLS 1.3
// - Database backups: Encrypted
```

**B. Access Control**
```sql
-- Row Level Security (RLS) - FERPA Compliance
-- Students can ONLY see their own data
CREATE POLICY "students_own_data" ON game_progress
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = profile_id);

-- Teachers can ONLY see their classroom
CREATE POLICY "teachers_own_classroom" ON game_progress
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    profile_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM profiles 
      WHERE account_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM accounts 
        WHERE owner_user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );

-- Parents can ONLY see their children
CREATE POLICY "parents_own_children" ON game_progress
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    profile_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM profiles 
      WHERE account_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM accounts 
        WHERE owner_user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );
```

**C. Authentication**
```javascript
// Strong authentication required
const authConfig = {
  passwordMinLength: 12,
  requireEmailVerification: true,
  sessionTimeout: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 30 days
  mfaRequired: false, // Optional but recommended for teachers
};
```

**D. Audit Logging**
```sql
-- Track all access to student data (FERPA requirement)
CREATE TABLE ferpa_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'VIEW', 'EXPORT', 'EDIT', 'DELETE'
  student_profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for quick lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_ferpa_audit_student ON ferpa_audit_log(student_profile_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ferpa_audit_timestamp ON ferpa_audit_log(timestamp DESC);
```

---

### 7. Data Retention and Deletion

FERPA doesn't specify retention periods, but best practice is:

#### Retention Policy:
| Data Type | Retention Period | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Active student data | While enrolled + 1 year | Ongoing education |
| Archived student data | 3 years after graduation | Historical records |
| Audit logs | 7 years | Legal compliance |
| Deleted account data | 90 days in trash | Recovery period |
| After permanent deletion | 0 days | Complete removal |

#### Automated Deletion:
```javascript
// Scheduled cleanup (runs monthly)
async function cleanupOldData() {
  // 1. Delete students who haven't logged in for 2 years
  await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .delete()
    .lt('last_played_at', twoYearsAgo);
  
  // 2. Permanently delete "trash" after 90 days
  await supabase
    .from('deleted_profiles')
    .delete()
    .lt('deleted_at', ninetyDaysAgo);
  
  // 3. Archive old audit logs to cold storage
  await archiveOldAuditLogs(sevenYearsAgo);
}
```

---

### 8. Third-Party Services (Subprocessors)

FERPA requires you to have agreements with ALL third-party services that handle student data.

#### Your Current Stack:
| Service | Handles Student Data? | FERPA Agreement Needed? | Status |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Supabase | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | Available |
| Netlify | ‚úÖ YES (serverless functions) | ‚úÖ YES | Available |
| Stripe | ‚ùå NO (parent billing only) | ‚ùå NO | N/A |
| OpenWeatherMap | ‚ùå NO (location data only) | ‚ùå NO | N/A |
| Unsplash/Pexels | ‚ùå NO (public photos) | ‚ùå NO | N/A |
| OpenAI API | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE (if student names sent) | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE | Check usage |

#### Required Agreements:
1. **Supabase:** Sign Business Associate Agreement (BAA) equivalent
2. **Netlify:** Review Terms of Service for FERPA compliance
3. **OpenAI:** If sending student data ‚Üí Need Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

**Action Item:** Review all API calls to ensure student names are NOT sent to AI services.

---

### 9. Breach Notification Requirements

If student data is compromised, you must:

#### Immediate Actions (24-48 hours):
1. **Contain the breach** - Stop unauthorized access
2. **Assess impact** - How many students affected?
3. **Notify affected schools** - Email/phone within 48 hours
4. **Document everything** - Timeline, scope, actions taken

#### Notification Requirements:
```javascript
// Breach notification template
const breachNotification = {
  to: ['school_principal@school.edu', 'teacher@school.edu'],
  subject: 'URGENT: Data Security Incident Notification',
  body: `

## üö® COMMON FERPA VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS:
1. **Public Leaderboards with Names**
   - ‚ùå "Top Scorers: 1. Emma S. (450 XP), 2. Liam R. (420 XP)"
   - ‚úÖ "Top Scorers: 1. Student A (450 XP), 2. Student B (420 XP)"
   - Or: Only show leaderboard to teacher

2. **Sharing Progress with Other Parents**
   - ‚ùå "Your child is in the bottom 25% of the class"
   - ‚úÖ "Your child has completed 15 of 20 challenges"

3. **Displaying Student Work Publicly**
   - ‚ùå Publishing student-created maps without consent
   - ‚úÖ Only show to teacher, require opt-in for public display

4. **Emailing Student Data**
   - ‚ùå Sending unencrypted emails with student scores
   - ‚úÖ Send secure links to password-protected dashboard

5. **Storing Data Indefinitely**
   - ‚ùå Keeping student data forever "just in case"
   - ‚úÖ Delete after retention period expires

6. **Weak Security**
   - ‚ùå Simple passwords like "password123"
   - ‚úÖ Enforce strong passwords (12+ characters)

7. **No Audit Trail**
   - ‚ùå No record of who accessed student data
   - ‚úÖ Log every access with timestamp and user
