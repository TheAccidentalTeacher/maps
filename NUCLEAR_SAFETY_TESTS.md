## 🧪 Enable Perplexity Verification (Optional Test)

### Step 1: Enable in .env
```bash
# Add this line to .env
ENABLE_PERPLEXITY_VERIFICATION=true
```

### Step 2: Restart Server
Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal) and restart:
```bash
node local-dev-server.js
```

### Step 3: Test Verification
```
http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/get-ai-facts?location=Paris&country=France
```

### Step 4: Check Response
Should now include `verification` object:
```json
{
  "facts": [...],
  "verification": {
    "assessment": "Fact 1 is accurate. Fact 2 is mostly accurate...",
    "citations": [
      "https://www.paris.fr/...",
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/..."
    ],
    "model": "sonar"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Monitor Cost
Watch for these console messages:
```
🔍 Verifying facts with Perplexity AI...
✅ Perplexity verification complete
📚 Citations: 4
```

**Cost Impact**: ~$0.01 per location (5x more expensive!)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Claude API returned: 404"
**Cause**: Claude API key invalid or expired  
**Solution**: Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env file

### Issue: Beer Festival Still Appearing
**Cause**: Fallback to GPT-4o-mini without nuclear prompts  
**Solution**: Verify Claude API key, or update GPT fallback with same filters

### Issue: Too Many Facts Rejected
**Cause**: Filter too strict (false positives)  
**Solution**: Review forbidden keywords list, adjust if needed

### Issue: Perplexity Not Running
**Cause**: ENABLE_PERPLEXITY_VERIFICATION not set to 'true'  
**Solution**: Add to .env and restart server
