#  DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

## Check Godot Output Panel:

1. In Godot (while game is running), look at the **bottom panel**
2. Click the **"Output"** tab
3. Look for any RED error messages
4. Tell me what errors you see (if any)

## Test Basic Controls:

1. **Mouse movement** - Does the orange selector follow your mouse?
2. **Q/E keys** - Does pressing Q or E change the building type?
3. **Left click** - Does clicking place a building?
4. **Right click** - Does right-clicking rotate the building preview?

## If Nothing Works:

The game might be paused or frozen. Try:
- Press **Escape** 
- Press **F8** to stop and restart

## Expected Behavior:

- Orange selector should follow mouse
- Q/E should cycle through different building types
- Left-click should place buildings (costs money)
- When money runs out  Math popup should appear
