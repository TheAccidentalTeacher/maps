## ✅ STEP 1: Run the SQL (2 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase dashboard**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fuppbkhfqutzcromomkc

2. **Click "SQL Editor"** (left sidebar)

3. **Click "New query"**

4. **Open this file in VS Code:**
   - `supabase-setup-complete.sql`

5. **Copy ALL the SQL** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

6. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor** (Ctrl+V)

7. **Click "Run"** (bottom right)

8. **You should see:**
   ```
   ✅ Tables created: 5
   ✅ Table Names:
   - accounts (23 columns)
   - profiles (17 columns)
   - game_progress (11 columns)
   - achievements (12 columns)
   - error_logs (15 columns)
   
   🎉 DATABASE SETUP COMPLETE! 🎉
   ```

## ✅ STEP 2: Enable Email Auth (1 minute)

1. **In Supabase, click "Authentication"** (left sidebar)

2. **Click "Providers"** tab

3. **Find "Email"** - should already be enabled ✅

4. **Scroll down to "Email Templates"**

5. **Confirm Email:** Leave default (we'll customize later)

6. **Done!** Email authentication is ready!

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Test It All Works (2 minutes)

**In Supabase SQL Editor → New Query:**

```sql
-- Verify all tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check Row Level Security is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**You should see:**
- 5 tables listed: accounts, achievements, error_logs, game_progress, profiles
- All have `rowsecurity = true` ✅

---

## 🎉 WHAT YOU JUST BUILT:

### ✅ **accounts table**
- Teachers and parents
- Subscription management
- Free access system (for your 15 students!)
- Email notifications
- FERPA compliance tracking

### ✅ **profiles table**
- Student profiles
- XP and level tracking
- Game settings
- Privacy controls

### ✅ **game_progress table**
- Tracks progress in each game mode
- Locations explored
- Challenges completed
- Time spent

### ✅ **achievements table**
- Tracks unlocked achievements
- XP rewards
- Email notifications
- Unlock context

### ✅ **error_logs table**
- Error tracking
- User context
- Resolution tracking
- Dashboard monitoring

### ✅ **Row Level Security**
- Teachers can ONLY see THEIR students
- Students can ONLY see THEIR data
- Enforced at DATABASE level (can't be bypassed!)

---

## 🔒 FERPA COMPLIANCE: ✅ BUILT IN!

- ✅ Row Level Security (database enforced)
- ✅ No sensitive student data (no last names, SSN, etc.)
- ✅ Audit logging (all timestamps tracked)
- ✅ Cascade deletes (delete teacher = delete all student data)
- ✅ Consent tracking (FERPA acknowledgment)
- ✅ Email notifications (optional)

**PostgreSQL enforces privacy at the database level!** 🔒

## 📊 DATABASE SCHEMA COMPLETE!

```
accounts (teachers/parents)
  └─ profiles (students)
      ├─ game_progress (game state)
      ├─ achievements (unlocked achievements)
      └─ error_logs (error tracking)
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEP: Create Your Teacher Account!

Once you've run the SQL, let me know and I'll help you:
1. Create your first teacher account
2. Create test student profiles
3. Test the Row Level Security
4. Add authentication UI to your app

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "relation already exists"
**Solution:** The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` - safe to re-run!

### Problem: "permission denied"
**Solution:** You might not be the owner. Go to Settings → Database → Connection String and verify you're using the correct project.

### Problem: Error with auth.users
**Solution:** The trigger for auto-creating accounts requires auth schema. It's built-in to Supabase, so this should work automatically.
