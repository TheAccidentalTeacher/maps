## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Create Database Schema ✅
**File:** `sql/create-city-progress-table.sql`

**What It Does:**
- Creates `city_progress` table in Supabase
- Stores all city data (buildings, cash, progress, times tables)
- 19 columns including JSONB for flexible building storage
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures students only see their own city
- Indexes optimize query performance
- Triggers auto-update timestamps

**Key Features:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE city_progress (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  buildings JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,      -- Dynamic building list
  cash DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 500.00,        -- Starting cash
  city_value DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0.00,    -- Unlock tiers
  current_tier INTEGER DEFAULT 1,           -- 1-4 progression
  times_tables_mastered INTEGER[],          -- Track mastered tables
  -- + 12 more columns
)
```

**RLS Policies:**
- Students can only SELECT/UPDATE their own city
- Teachers can view all cities (for future dashboard)
- Prevents data tampering or viewing other students' progress

**How to Run:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Paste contents of `sql/create-city-progress-table.sql`
3. Click "Run" button
4. Check verification queries at bottom of file

---

### Task 1.2: Create File Structure ✅
**Directories Created:**

```
assets/city-builder/
  ├── sprites/
  │   ├── tier1/         (Starter buildings: $500-$2K)
  │   ├── tier2/         (Medium buildings: $5K-$7K)
  │   ├── tier3/         (Advanced: $10K-$15K)
  │   └── tier4/         (Endgame: $100K skyscraper)
  ├── roads/             (Road tiles for connections)
  ├── ui/                (Buttons, icons, HUD elements)
  └── data/              (JSON building definitions)

scripts/city-builder/    (JS modules - Phase 2)
styles/                  (CSS files if needed)
```

**Why This Structure:**
- **Tier-based organization:** Easy to load only unlocked buildings
- **Scalable:** Can add 100+ buildings without clutter
- **Performance:** Load textures on-demand (Chromebook optimization)
- **Asset pipeline:** Artists can export directly to tier folders

---

### Task 1.3: Create Building Data ✅
**File:** `assets/city-builder/data/buildings.json`

**Buildings Defined:**

**Tier 1 (Unlocked from start):**
- 🏚️ Small Shack - $500, income $10/quiz
- 🏡 House - $800, income $16/quiz
- 🏢 Office - $1,200, income $24/quiz
- 🏪 Shop - $1,500, income $30/quiz
- 🏬 Mini Mall - $2,000, income $40/quiz

**Tier 2 (Unlock at $10K city value):**
- 🏭 Factory - $5,000, income $100/quiz
- 🏢 Skyscraper - $6,000, income $120/quiz
- 🏫 School - $7,000, income $140/quiz

**Tier 3 (Unlock at $100K city value):**
- 🏰 Castle - $10,000, income $500/quiz
- 🏛️ Grand Hall - $15,000, income $750/quiz

**Tier 4 (Unlock at $1M city value):**
- 🌟 Mega Tower - $100,000, income $5,000/quiz

**Economic Balance:**
- **Linear progression:** Each tier is 5-10× more expensive
- **Income scaling:** Rewards delayed gratification (save for big buildings)
- **Unlock gates:** City value prevents rushing to endgame
- **Achievable goals:** Even small buildings contribute to value

**JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "tier1": [
    {
      "id": "house",
      "name": "House",
      "description": "A cozy home for citizens",
      "cost": 800,
      "income": 16,
      "tier": 1,
      "size": {"width": 2, "height": 2},
      "sprite": "/assets/city-builder/sprites/tier1/house.png",
      "unlockRequirement": {
        "type": "start",
        "value": 0,
        "description": "Available from start"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Task 1.4: Create HTML Page ✅
**File:** `math-city-builder.html`

**What It Does:**
- **Standalone page:** Works independently from main Geography app
- **Supabase connection:** Loads official client library (v2)
- **Authentication check:** Redirects to login if not logged in
- **Load/create city:** First visit creates new city, subsequent visits load saved data
- **Auto-save:** Saves every 30 seconds automatically
- **Save on exit:** `beforeunload` event saves before closing tab

**Key Features:**

**1. Authentication System:**
```javascript
async function checkAuth() {
  const { data: { session }, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (!session) {
    window.location.href = '/login.html';  // Redirect if not logged in
    return false;
  }
  currentUser = session.user;
  return true;
}
```

**2. Load or Create City:**
```javascript
async function loadCityData() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('city_progress')
    .select('*')
    .eq('student_id', currentUser.id)
    .single();
  
  if (data) {
    cityData = data;  // Load existing city
  } else {
    cityData = await createNewCity();  // First time playing
  }
}
```

**3. Auto-Save System:**
```javascript
// Save every 30 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  await saveCityData();
}, 30000);

// Save before closing tab
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', async () => {
  await saveCityData();
});
```

**4. UI Components:**
- **Header:** Shows cash, XP, city value, back/logout buttons
- **Sidebar:** City stats, building list (tier-based), quiz button
- **Canvas:** 800×600px rendering area (grid overlay ready)
- **Loading screen:** Prevents interaction until data loaded

**5. Responsive Design:**
- **Flex layout:** Sidebar (320px) + Canvas (flex-grow)
- **Scrollable sidebar:** If many buildings (overflow-y: auto)
- **Chromebook optimized:** 1366×768 minimum resolution
- **Purple gradient theme:** Matches main Geography app

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Modular functions (init, load, save, update UI)
- ✅ Error handling (try/catch blocks)
- ✅ Console logging (debug breadcrumbs)
- ✅ Comments explaining each section
- ✅ DRY principles (no code duplication)

---

### Task 1.5: Add Supabase Connection ✅
**Already Integrated in HTML**

**Supabase Configuration:**
```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://fuppbkhfqutzcromomkc.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';

const supabase = window.supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {
  auth: {
    storage: window.localStorage,      // Persist session
    autoRefreshToken: true,             // Auto-refresh expired tokens
    persistSession: true,               // Remember login
    detectSessionInUrl: true            // Handle OAuth callbacks
  }
});
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Uses anonymous key (safe for client-side)
- ✅ RLS policies enforce row-level security
- ✅ Students cannot access other students' data
- ✅ SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)

**Connection Verified:**
- ✅ Console logs: "✅ Supabase initialized"
- ✅ Authentication check runs on page load
- ✅ Database queries use proper error handling

---

### Task 1.6: Link from Main App ✅
**File:** `index.html` (modified)

**What Changed:**
Added button after Ocean Explorer button in sidebar:

```html
<!-- Math City Builder Button -->
<button class="btn math-city-btn" 
        onclick="window.location.href='/math-city-builder.html'" 
        style="margin-top: 10px; 
               background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); 
               color: white; 
               border: none;">
    🏙️ BUILD YOUR MATH CITY! 🎓
</button>
```

**Design Details:**
- **Purple gradient:** Matches Math City Builder theme
- **Emoji icons:** Gen Alpha-friendly visual appeal
- **Same styling:** Consistent with Ocean Explorer button
- **Always visible:** Unlike Ocean Explorer (only on ocean tiles)

**User Flow:**
1. Student logs into Geography Detective Academy
2. Explores locations (earns XP, builds collection)
3. Clicks **"🏙️ BUILD YOUR MATH CITY!"** button
4. Math City Builder loads with their saved city

- ✅ City value unlocks tiers → Incentivizes repeated practice
- ✅ Income per building → Rewards mastery (build more → earn more)

**Engagement Hooks:**
- ✅ Persistent city → Students see long-term progress
- ✅ Tier system → Clear goals ("Reach $10K to unlock tier 2!")
- ✅ Building variety → 11+ buildings (planned: 50+)
- ✅ Visual feedback → City grows as they learn

**FERPA Compliance:**
- ✅ RLS policies → Students isolated from each other
- ✅ No PII exposed → Only student_id (UUID) stored
- ✅ Teacher dashboard ready → Can add SELECT policy later
