# ‚úÖ ITERATION 1 COMPLETE - Visual Foundation & Asset Management

**Date Completed:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ITERATION 1 COMPLETE (simplified scope)  
**Progress:** 70% complete ‚Üí Math City Builder

---

## üéØ Iteration 1 Goals (from BUILDING_LAYER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features:

1. **Decoration Stacking System** ‚úÖ
   - Modified `isCellOccupied()` to allow tier 0 (decorations) to overlap
   - Multiple trees/grass/roads can now be placed on same tile
   - Depth sorting creates natural layered appearance
   - Buildings (tier 1+) still require empty tiles

2. **Sprite Alignment Improvements** ‚úÖ
   - Pine trees (`coniferTall.png`, `coniferShort.png`) float 5px higher (yOffset = 1)
   - Per-sprite vertical offset system implemented
   - Trees now sit naturally on terrain without clipping

3. **Asset Reference Gallery** ‚úÖ NEW TOOL!
   - Comprehensive visual catalog of ALL 822 PNG assets
   - 8 categories: buildings (645), city-details (30), decorations (24), nature (18), roads (16), terrain (15), vehicles (64), water (10)
   - Interactive checkbox system for asset selection
   - Notes field for each asset
   - localStorage persistence (saves selections between sessions)
   - Category filtering (view by buildings, decorations, etc.)
   - Export feature generates JSON file with selections
   - Linked from main game via "üé® Asset Gallery" button

4. **Composite Rendering Investigation** ‚ö†Ô∏è ABANDONED
   - Attempted to implement base + roof sprite layering
   - Discovered asset library doesn't have separate base/roof sprites
   - All sprites are complete buildings (no decomposition possible)
   - Code prepared but disabled (commented with explanation)
   - **Lesson learned:** Asset limitations require adaptive approach

### ‚ùå Deferred/Not Completed:

1. **Sub-tile Positioning** ‚ùå REVERTED
   - Attempted 5-position system (center + 4 corners) for decorations
   - Failed due to sprite anchor point inconsistencies
   - Tree bases not uniformly positioned within PNG files
   - Offsetting PNG != offsetting visual tree base
   - **Decision:** Reverted to simple center-snapping for predictable behavior

---

## üîß Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

**game.js:**
- `isCellOccupied()` line 326-328: Added `&& b.tier > 0` check
- Allows decorations to stack freely while keeping buildings exclusive

**canvas.js:**
- Lines 197-202: Per-sprite yOffset system
- Pine trees: `yOffset = 1` (5px float)
- Other decorations: `yOffset = 6` (ground level)
- Buildings: `yOffset = -25` (float above brown base)

**index.html:**
- Line 30: Added "üé® Asset Gallery" link to top UI bar
- Cache version bumped to v8

### New Files Created:

**asset-reference.html:**
- Full-featured asset gallery (540 lines)
- Responsive grid layout (auto-sizing based on screen width)
- Category-based filtering system
- Checkbox selection with localStorage persistence
- Notes system for asset annotations
- Export to JSON feature
- Lazy loading for performance

**asset-list.json:**
- Generated via PowerShell script
- Contains all 822 PNG file paths relative to website root
- Used by asset-reference.html to dynamically load images

## üìä Asset Discovery

**Total Assets Found:** 822 PNGs (not 200-220 as initially estimated!)

**Breakdown by Category:**
```
buildings/      645 files (buildingTiles_000.png ‚Üí buildingTiles_644.png)
city-details/    30 files
decorations/     24 files
nature/          18 files
roads/           16 files
terrain/         15 files
vehicles/        64 files
water/           10 files
```

**Key Insight:** Full Kenney City Builder Pack is present! Much larger asset library than initially realized.

## üéÆ User Experience Improvements

**Before Iteration 1:**
- Decorations couldn't stack (collision detection too strict)
- Trees clipped through terrain
- No visibility into available assets
- Sub-tile positioning attempted but unusable

**After Iteration 1:**
- ‚úÖ Trees/grass/roads can layer naturally on same tile
- ‚úÖ Pine trees float correctly above ground
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive asset gallery for planning future content
- ‚úÖ Simple, predictable decoration placement (center-snap)
- ‚úÖ Selection/notes system for asset curation workflow

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

1. **Decoration Collision Bug** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue:** Trees couldn't be placed on grass tiles
   - **Cause:** `isCellOccupied()` blocked ALL overlaps
   - **Fix:** Added tier check - only buildings (tier 1+) block placement

2. **Pine Tree Clipping** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue:** Pine trees appeared to sink into terrain
   - **Cause:** Same yOffset used for all decorations
   - **Fix:** Sprite-specific offset (pine trees float 5px higher)

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked:
- Simple stacking system (tier-based collision) is robust and maintainable
- Per-sprite offsets allow fine-tuning without complex systems
- Asset gallery tool provides clear workflow for content planning
- localStorage persistence prevents data loss during asset review

### What Didn't Work:
- Sub-tile positioning (sprite anchor points inconsistent)
- Composite rendering (assets don't support decomposition)
- Complex offset calculations (sprite artwork varies too much)

### Design Philosophy:
**"Work with the assets, not against them"** - Attempting features unsupported by asset structure leads to brittle, unpredictable behavior. Simple, asset-aware solutions are more robust.

## üöÄ Next Steps (Iteration 2)

**Focus:** Asset Pipeline & Content Expansion

**Planned Features:**
1. Review 822 assets in asset gallery, select ~100-150 for game inclusion
2. Categorize selected assets (tier assignments, costs, unlock levels)
3. Generate new `buildings.js` from curated selections
4. Add roofs as separate tier (if suitable roof assets found)
5. Add city details (flags, antennas, chimneys) as decoration tier
6. Implement visual variety (multiple sprites per building type)

**Dependencies:**
- User completes asset gallery review
- Export JSON file with selections
- Analysis of which assets work as roofs vs complete buildings

## üìà Game Completion Status

**Iteration 0:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (baseline + debug tools)  
**Iteration 1:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (visual foundation + asset tools)
