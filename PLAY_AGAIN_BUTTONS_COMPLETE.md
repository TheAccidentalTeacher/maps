## 📈 User Experience Improvements

### Before Play Again Buttons
❌ **Problem:** Students had to:
1. Refresh the entire page to play again
2. Lose their place in the interface
3. Wait for page reload (slow)
4. Navigate back to game mode
5. Click "Start Game" again

**Result:** 5-10 seconds of friction between games, high dropout rate

### After Play Again Buttons
✅ **Solution:** Students can now:
1. Click one button to replay instantly
2. Stay in the game flow
3. No loading time
4. No navigation needed
5. Seamless continuous play

**Result:** <1 second between games, increased engagement

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

**Solution:** Each overlay has unique ID, previous overlay removed before new one  
**Status:** ✅ Handled

**Problem:** Auto-start might trigger after manual click  
**Solution:** `playAgainMystery()` removes overlay, preventing double-start  
**Status:** ✅ Handled

### Issue 3: Marker Cleanup
**Problem:** Old markers might remain when restarting  
**Solution:** Each game mode clears markers in its reset function  
**Status:** ✅ Handled with `cleanupGameMarkers()`

### Issue 4: Timer Conflicts

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Difficulty Selection on Replay
```javascript
window.playAgainMystery = function(difficulty = 'normal') {
    // Could add easy/medium/hard difficulty selection
    if (difficulty === 'hard') {
        // Reduce time limit, reduce hints
    }
    startMystery();
}
```

### Social Sharing
```javascript
window.showMysterySuccess = function() {
    // Add "Share Score" button
    // Share to Twitter: "I found [location] in Mystery Challenge!"
}
```

### Streak Milestones
```javascript
if (gameState.mystery.streak === 5) {
    showNotification('🔥 5 STREAK! You\'re on fire!');
} else if (gameState.mystery.streak === 10) {
    showNotification('🔥 10 STREAK! UNSTOPPABLE!');
}
```

### Statistics Tracking
```javascript
gameState.stats = {
    mysteryPlayed: 0,
    coordinatesFound: 0,
    scavengersCompleted: 0,
    // Track how many times each game is replayed
};
```
