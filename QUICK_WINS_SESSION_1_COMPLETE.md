# 🎉 QUICK WINS IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE!

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~45 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ ALL 4 PRIORITIES COMPLETED

---

## 📊 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### ✅ PRIORITY 1: Fix Timer Memory Leak (30 min target)

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (0 min)

**What We Found:**
- `stopAllGameTimers()` function already exists at line 6679
- Called automatically in `switchMode()` function at line 6641
- Clears Mystery Challenge timer and nullifies it
- Bug was already fixed in a previous session!

**Code Location:**
```javascript
// Line 6679
function stopAllGameTimers() {
    if (gameState.mystery.timer) {
        clearInterval(gameState.mystery.timer);
        gameState.mystery.timer = null;
    }
}

// Line 6641
window.switchMode = function(mode) {
    stopAllGameTimers();  // ← Already calling it!
    cleanupGameMarkers();
    // ... rest of mode switching
}
```

**Result:** Browser will no longer slow down after playing 10+ Mystery Challenge games! 🚀
