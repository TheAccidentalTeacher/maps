- Reverse geocoding via Nominatim with 1-second throttling and AbortController cancellation.
- Photo facts matched through `match-photos-to-facts` Netlify function ‚Üí Vision AI verifies alignment.
- Achievements tie-ins for markers placed, countries visited, distinct continents explored.
- Documentation: `LOCATION_EXPLORER_SIDEBAR_PLAN.md`, `PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md`, `PHOTO_FACT_MATCHING.md`, `PHOTO_MODAL_COMPLETE.md`, `ENHANCED_PHOTO_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md`.

| Ocean Explorer | Optional deep-dive spin-off | ‚úÖ Maintained | Uses dedicated HTML + data files |

### Achievement & XP Engine
- 45 achievements with rarity tiers; triggers confetti overlay and toast messaging.
- Stats tracked per mode (`playerAchievements.stats`).
- Auto-save to localStorage; optional Supabase persistence via `game_progress` table.
- Latest changes: Explore achievements incremented on `showLocationInfo` and `populateLocationData`; multiple redundant checks removed.
- Docs: `ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKS_COMPLETE.md`, `ACHIEVEMENT_TESTING.md`, `GEN_ALPHA_ACHIEVEMENTS.md`.

### Nuclear Safety System
- Prompt guard + post-generation filter lives inside AI fetch wrappers.
- `NUCLEAR_SAFETY_SYSTEM.md` documents forbidden keyword list and override logic.
- `NUCLEAR_SAFETY_TESTS.md` provides regression scenarios; October QA run in `test_results.md` backlog.
- Vision AI photo validation integrated to prevent mismatched images.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Data & Persistence

| Layer | Details |
| --- | --- |
| LocalStorage | `geoDetectiveState` stores XP, mode stats, heists. Autosave triggered on state change. Quota guard still outstanding (see `BUGS_DETAILED.md`). |
| Supabase Tables | `accounts`, `game_progress`, `ocean_species_discoveries`. Schemas in `/sql/*.sql`. RLS policies ensure teacher/student scoping. |
| Netlify Functions | Located in `/netlify/functions/`. Provide access to Claude/GPT, Unsplash, Pexels, OpenWeather, Overpass, and Vision AI.
| Environment Variables | `.env.example` lists required keys. Use `netlify dev` or `local-dev-server.js` proxy for local testing with functions. |

### Active Netlify Functions

| Function | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get-ai-facts.js` | Claude 3.5 fact generation with GPT-4o-mini fallback. Applies nuclear filter. |
| `match-photos-to-facts.js` | Creates fact-specific photo prompts, validates with Vision AI. |
| `get-photos.js` | General photo retrieval with safe search. |
| `get-weather.js` | Current conditions via OpenWeather. |
| `generate-real-life-geography.js` | AI-generated real-world applications. |
| `get-species-photos.js` / `get-species-ai-facts.js` | Ocean Explorer-specific helpers. |

Documentation: `NETLIFY_FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md`, `NETLIFY_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md`, `AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`.

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### Regression Checklist (Oct‚ÄØ2025)

1. **Explore Mode**
   - Click 5 random locations ‚Üí verify cards populate; check throttling prevents API spam.
   - Confirm `cleanupGameMarkers()` leaves only active markers after mode switches.
   - Validate Vision AI logs success/fail in console when photos requested.
2. **Mystery Challenge**
   - Start game ‚Üí switch to Scavenger ‚Üí confirm timer cleared.
   - Resume Mystery ‚Üí ensure streak and progress correct after mode swap.
3. **Achievements**
   - Trigger `Explorer` achievements via Explore markers.
   - Unlock one Alaska badge; ensure toast appears once.
   - Refresh page; verify achievements persist (localStorage + optional Supabase).
4. **Safety**
   - Force banned keyword; ensure rejection message displayed.
   - Run `NUCLEAR_SAFETY_TESTS.md` prompts for Colorado/Amsterdam/Las Vegas cases.
5. **Create a Heist**
   - Enter >200 char clue; observe TODO for sanitization (see bug backlog).

Record results in `test_results.md`; update `TESTING_GUIDE.md` if procedures change.

### Known Open Items (see `BUGS_DETAILED.md` for full context)
- Input sanitization & length limits for Create-a-Heist fields.
- LocalStorage quota guard + pruning for large heist collections.
- Mystery Challenge pause/resume button (requested by students).
- Additional dataset variety for Scavenger/Guess games.

## üîÑ Maintenance Protocol

1. When modifying a major subsystem (Location Explorer, achievements, safety, AI pipelines, game modes), update this index and note the change in `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`.
2. Keep `index.html` anchor comments accurate; they are referenced throughout this index.
3. Archive superseded documentation in the `/handoff-docs/` folder or append a **Deprecated** banner rather than deleting.
4. Rerun the documentation cross-reference checklist in `DOCUMENTATION_CROSS_REFERENCE_MAP.md` before shipping large doc edits.
