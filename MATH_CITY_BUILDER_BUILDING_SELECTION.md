## Visual Reference Guide

### How to Verify Your Selections

1. **Open Preview.png** in the buildings folder
2. **Look at the grid** - files are numbered sequentially
3. **Match numbers** to our selections above
4. **Verify visual progression:**
   - Tier 1 should look "small and simple"
   - Tier 2 should look "medium and detailed"
   - Tier 3 should look "large and professional"
   - Tier 4 should look "tall and impressive"
   - Tier 5 should look "massive and iconic"

### Color Check
- **Tier 1:** Should see rainbow of house colors
- **Tier 2:** Should see variety of architectural styles
- **Tier 3:** Should see taller buildings with professional look
- **Tier 4:** Should see skyscrapers and civic buildings
- **Tier 5:** Should see massive towers and landmarks

## Student Perspective Test

### "Would a 3rd grader be excited about this building?"

✅ **YES for:**
- Colorful houses (Tier 1)
- Pizza restaurant (Tier 3)
- School building (Tier 4) - "That's where I go!"
- Fire station (Tier 4) - "Firefighters are cool!"
- Stadium (Tier 5) - "Sports!"
- Math Museum (Tier 5) - "Math can be fun!"

❌ **AVOID:**
- All-gray boring buildings
- Identical duplicates
- Unclear purpose buildings
- Too-similar variations

Our 50 selections pass the "3rd grader excitement test"! ✅
