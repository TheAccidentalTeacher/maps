## 🎯 TESTING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Quick Smoke Test (15 minutes)
1. Open each game mode
2. Check if it loads without errors
3. Try one basic action in each mode
4. Document which modes work vs. broken

### Phase 2: Deep Testing (1 hour per mode)
1. Follow detailed test plan in TESTING_SESSION.md
2. Test every feature thoroughly
3. Document all bugs found
4. Note improvements needed

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes (Variable time)
1. Fix critical bugs first
2. Fix high-priority bugs next
3. Defer low-priority bugs if time-limited

### Phase 4: Student Testing (30 minutes)
1. Have 2-3 students test each mode
2. Watch them play without guidance
3. Note confusion points
4. Collect feedback
