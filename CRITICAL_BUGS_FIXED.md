## 🐛 Bug #1: Memory Leak in Mystery Mode Timer

### Problem Fixed
- ✅ Timer kept running when switching modes
- ✅ Multiple timers accumulated causing browser slowdown
- ✅ `event.target` reference error in switchMode
- ✅ No cleanup on page close/refresh

### Solution Implemented
1. Created `stopAllGameTimers()` - Centralized timer cleanup
2. Created `cleanupGameMarkers()` - Centralized marker cleanup
3. Fixed `switchMode()` - Removed broken event.target reference
4. Added `beforeunload` listener - Cleanup on page close
5. Call cleanup functions on every mode switch

### Testing
**Quick Test:**
1. Start Mystery Challenge → timer counts (60, 59, 58...)
2. Switch to Explore mode → timer STOPS
3. Switch back to Mystery → fresh timer state
4. **Expected:** No errors, timer stops cleanly

## 🐛 Bug #2: Race Condition in Location Fetch

### Problem Fixed
- ✅ Rapid clicking caused wrong location data to display
- ✅ Multiple API requests fired simultaneously
- ✅ No rate limiting (violated Nominatim terms)
- ✅ No error handling for failed requests
- ✅ Confusing error messages

### Solution Implemented
1. **AbortController** - Cancel previous requests before starting new ones
2. **Rate Limiting** - 1-second minimum delay between API calls
3. **Request Tracking** - Track and abort in-flight requests
4. **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
5. **Status Checking** - Validate HTTP responses
6. **Abort Detection** - Don't show errors for cancelled requests

### Key Features
```javascript
// Cancel previous request
if (currentFetchController) {
    currentFetchController.abort();
}

// Rate limit (1 second between calls)
if (timeSinceLastFetch < 1000) {
    await delay(1000 - timeSinceLastFetch);
}

// Use AbortController
const signal = new AbortController().signal;
fetch(url, { signal });

// Handle abort gracefully
if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
    return; // Don't show error
}
```

### Testing
**Quick Test:**
1. Click 10 locations rapidly across the map
2. **Expected:** Only last clicked location shows data
3. **Expected:** No "Error loading location" messages
4. **Expected:** Console shows "Cancelled previous location fetch"
5. Check browser network tab - no excessive requests

## 🐛 Bug #3: Marker Accumulation

### Problem Fixed
- ✅ Markers piled up and weren't removed
- ✅ Only one global `currentMarker` variable
- ✅ Some game modes created markers without tracking
- ✅ Coordinate Finder `revealMarker` not cleaned up
- ✅ Map became cluttered with old markers

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced cleanupGameMarkers()** - Remove all marker types
2. **currentMarker cleanup** - Remove and nullify
3. **revealMarker cleanup** - Remove Coordinate Finder markers
4. **Orphan Detection** - Find and remove untracked markers
5. **Error Handling** - Try/catch for safe removal
6. **Call on mode switch** - Clean markers when changing modes

### Key Features
```javascript
function cleanupGameMarkers() {
    // Remove tracked markers
    if (currentMarker) { 
        geoMap.removeLayer(currentMarker);
        currentMarker = null;
    }
    
    if (revealMarker) {
        geoMap.removeLayer(revealMarker);
        revealMarker = null;
    }
    
    // Remove any orphaned markers
    geoMap.eachLayer(function(layer) {
        if (layer instanceof L.Marker) {
            geoMap.removeLayer(layer);
        }
    });
}
```

### Testing
**Quick Test:**
1. Play multiple game modes (Mystery, Alaska, Explore)
2. Click locations in each mode
3. Switch between modes 10 times
4. **Expected:** Map should be clean (no marker buildup)
5. **Expected:** Console shows "Removed X markers"

### Test Suite #3: Marker Cleanup (Bug #3)
- [ ] Play each game mode → switch away → map clears
- [ ] Start Mystery, Alaska, Create heist → switch → no marker buildup
- [ ] Use Coordinate Finder → switch modes → reveal marker removed
- [ ] Play 10 games → inspect map → should be clean
- [ ] Console shows "Removed X markers" when switching

### Test Suite #4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Play all 6 game modes in sequence
- [ ] Switch modes rapidly while games are active
- [ ] Click locations while switching modes
- [ ] Leave browser idle for 5 minutes → no issues
- [ ] Play for 30 minutes continuously → no performance degradation

### Test Suite #5: Error Handling
- [ ] Disconnect internet → click location → friendly error
- [ ] Reconnect internet → click location → loads normally
- [ ] Click very rapidly (20 clicks/second) → no crashes
- [ ] Switch modes while location loading → no errors

## 🔍 How to Verify Fixes Work

### Check Timer is Stopped
```javascript
// Open console (F12) and type:
console.log('Timer:', gameState.mystery.timer);
// Should show: null (when not in Mystery mode)
```

### Check for Orphaned Markers
```javascript
// Open console and type:
let markerCount = 0;
geoMap.eachLayer(layer => {
    if (layer instanceof L.Marker) markerCount++;
});
console.log('Markers on map:', markerCount);
// Should show: 0 or 1 (current marker only)
```

### Check Fetch Controller
```javascript
// Open console and type:
console.log('Fetch controller:', currentFetchController);
// Should show: null (when not loading location)
```

### Force Full Cleanup
```javascript
// Open console and type:
stopAllGameTimers();
cleanupGameMarkers();
console.log('Full cleanup executed!');
```

🧹 Removed reveal marker
🚫 Cancelled previous location fetch
✅ Location fetch cancelled (user clicked elsewhere)
```

### Warning Messages (OK) ⚠️

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Technical Lessons
1. **Always cancel previous async operations** - AbortController is essential
2. **Rate limiting is critical** - Respect API limits, better UX
3. **Centralized cleanup** - One function for all timer/marker cleanup
4. **Defensive coding** - Try/catch, null checks, error handling
5. **Console logging** - Helps debug and verify fixes work

### Development Lessons
1. **Fix critical bugs first** - Foundation before features
2. **Test systematically** - Written test plans catch more bugs
3. **Create backups** - Easy rollback if something breaks
4. **Document everything** - Future you will thank present you
5. **One bug at a time** - Easier to test and verify

## ✅ Success Criteria

**All 3 bugs are FIXED if:**
- ✅ Timer stops when switching modes (no background counting)
- ✅ Only last clicked location loads (no race conditions)
- ✅ Map stays clean (no marker accumulation)
- ✅ No console errors during normal usage
- ✅ Browser stays responsive after 30+ minutes
- ✅ Memory usage stays stable (<200MB)
- ✅ All game modes work smoothly

**If ANY of these fail:**
- Review test results
- Check console for specific errors
- Use debugging commands above
- May need additional fixes

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Timer Still Running in Background?
- Check: `console.log(gameState.mystery.timer)`
- Should be: `null` when not in Mystery mode
- If not null: `stopAllGameTimers()` to force stop

### Location Data Wrong?
- Check network tab for multiple simultaneous requests
- Should see: Previous requests cancelled
- If not: Clear cache and refresh

### Markers Accumulating?
- Check: Run marker count command above
- Should be: 0-1 markers
- If more: Run `cleanupGameMarkers()` manually

### Console Errors?
- Take screenshot
- Note which action caused error
- Check if it's one of the "bad messages" above
