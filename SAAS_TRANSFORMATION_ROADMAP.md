```

### SaaS Stack (Proposed)
```
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (same!)
Auth: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

## 💬 DECISION TIME

You have **three options**:

### Option A: Students First (Recommended)
- Deploy simple auth **this week** (3 hours)
- Students start playing
- Build SaaS in parallel (evenings/weekends)
- Launch publicly in 4 weeks

### Option B: SaaS First
- Build complete SaaS system (56 hours)
- Students wait 3-4 weeks
- Launch to students AND families simultaneously

### Option C: Classroom Only
- Keep current localStorage system
- No authentication needed
- Students play locally
- Skip SaaS for now

**My Recommendation:** **Option A - Students First**

**Why:**
1. Students get value NOW (no more waiting!)
2. Real feedback validates your product
3. SaaS builds in parallel (lower risk)
4. Two revenue streams (schools + families)
5. Faster to first paying customer
