**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Time Investment So Far:** ~3 hours  
**Construct 3 License:** $168 (purchased today)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Phases 1-3)

### What's Actually Built:
- [x] Construct 3 project "City Builder" created
- [x] 1920√ó1080 viewport configured
- [x] 6 layers set up (Layer 0, CityGround, Buildings, Effects, Hud, Modal)
- [x] 3D rendering tested (dice cube visible in 3D)
- [x] Green grass background added (TiledBackground2)
- [x] Preview works (F5 shows game)

### Files Created:
- Construct 3 project file (saved in browser/cloud)
- CONSTRUCT3_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (our main roadmap)
- CONSTRUCT3_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md (technical reference)
- CITY_ASSETS_INVENTORY.md (200+ Kenney assets cataloged)
- MATH_CITY_BUILDER_MASTER_PLAN.md (updated with architecture change)

## üéØ NEXT STEP: Phase 4 - Install Addons (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Get the 3DObject addon so we can import Kenney GLB buildings

**What We'll Do:**
1. Menu ‚Üí View ‚Üí Addon Manager
2. Search for "3DObject" by Mikal
3. Click "Install"
4. Restart Construct 3 if prompted
5. Verify addon appears in "Insert new object" list

**Critical:** Without this addon, we CANNOT import the Kenney GLB models!

**Other addons to install (while we're there):**
- Touch Plus (Iain) - Prevents clicking through UI
- LiteTween (Lunarray) - Smooth animations
- Better Outline (skymen) - Highlight selected buildings
- Doodle Sprite (skymen) - Wobble effect
- Radial Progress (Emanuele) - Quiz timer

## üî• REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

**What's True:**
- We're ~20% done with basic setup
- The hard parts (events, logic, camera) are still ahead
- Manual work = slow progress
- This will take multiple sessions

**What's Also True:**
- You paid $168 - we're committed to making it work
- Each phase builds on the last (incremental progress)
- Once addons are installed, importing buildings gets easier
- The game WILL work when we're done

## üí° TODAY'S LESSON LEARNED

**"Visual game engines" ‚â† "Easy game engines"**

Construct 3 is VISUAL (drag-drop, no code syntax), but it's NOT QUICK.  
Every object, property, behavior, and event requires manual configuration.

Compare to writing code:
- **Code:** Type `background.color = 'green'` (5 seconds)
- **Construct 3:** Insert object ‚Üí Configure properties ‚Üí Resize ‚Üí Position (5 minutes)

**Trade-off:** Construct 3 is better for 3D and asset management, but slower for basic setup.

## üìã BEFORE NEXT PHASE CHECKLIST

Before we start Phase 4 (Install Addons), let's verify:

- [ ] Construct 3 project is saved (File ‚Üí Save project)
- [ ] You can see the green background + dice cube in preview (F5)
- [ ] All documentation is updated (‚úÖ DONE - just updated)
- [ ] You're mentally prepared for addon installation (30 min process)

**Ready to continue with Phase 4?** Say "let's install addons" when ready! üöÄ
