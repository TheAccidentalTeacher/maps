# Math City Builder - Development Journey

**Project:** Educational Math City Builder for K-5 Students  
**Goal:** Minecraft meets Roblox meets SimCity for multiplication table practice  
**Timeline:** October 25, 2025 (Single Day)  
**Budget:** Limited educator funds ($168 at risk with Construct 3)

---

## Executive Summary

After 3 failed attempts using visual game engines (Three.js, Construct 3, GDevelop), we are **pivoting to custom 2D JavaScript code** written by AI assistant. This approach offers:
- ✅ Full control over codebase
- ✅ Zero subscription costs ($0 forever)
- ✅ Direct Supabase integration
- ✅ Works on school Chromebooks
- ✅ AI can write actual code vs. guiding through UI clicks

**Key Lesson:** For educational games with specific requirements, custom code > visual editors

---

## Attempt 1: Three.js (3D Web Framework)

**Duration:** 20+ hours over multiple sessions  
**Cost:** $0 (free library)  
**Result:** ❌ FAILED

### What We Tried
- Used Three.js library for 3D rendering in browser
- Attempted to load Kenney GLB city building models
- Tried to implement rotating camera controls
- Attempted texture loading and lighting setup

### Why It Failed
1. **Complexity:** Three.js requires deep understanding of 3D graphics, cameras, lighting, materials
2. **Model Loading Issues:** GLB files wouldn't render properly (geometry loaded but textures failed)
3. **Camera Controls:** Implementing orbital camera was more complex than expected
4. **Time Investment:** 20+ hours with no working prototype
5. **Learning Curve:** Too steep for someone without 3D graphics background

### Technical Blockers
- Texture loading pipeline wasn't working
- Camera controls felt "floaty" and unresponsive
- Performance issues on basic hardware
- No clear path forward without learning advanced WebGL concepts

### Lessons Learned
- 3D is significantly harder than 2D for web games
- Libraries like Three.js assume you know 3D graphics fundamentals
- Asset pipeline (models, textures, materials) is complex
- Time spent debugging > time spent building game mechanics

**Decision:** Abandoned Three.js, sought visual editor alternative

---

## Attempt 2: Construct 3 (Visual Game Editor)

**Duration:** 4+ hours (research + purchase + testing)  
**Cost:** $168 (Annual License)  
**Result:** ❌ FAILED - REFUND REQUESTED

### What We Tried
1. Researched Construct 3 capabilities (tutorials, forums, documentation)
2. Read official 3D features tutorial (isometric city builder example)
3. Purchased $168 annual license
4. Attempted to import Kenney GLB 3D models
5. Discovered critical dealbreaker within hours

### Why It Failed
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The 3DObject addon (only way to import GLB/GLTF models) is **legacy SDK v1** and incompatible with current Construct 3 version.

#### Technical Details
- Construct 3 migrated from SDK v1 to SDK v2
- 3DObject addon by Mikal is SDK v1 (no longer supported)
- Addon marketplace shows the addon but blocks installation
- No SDK v2 replacement exists or is planned
- Built-in "3D Shape" object only supports primitives (box, pyramid, wedge)
- Cannot import external 3D model files

#### Why This Is A Dealbreaker
- Kenney asset library has 200+ GLB buildings (unusable in Construct 3)
- Converting GLB to 2D sprites defeats purpose of rotating camera
- No workaround exists that preserves project requirements
- Spent $168 for feature that's advertised but unavailable

### Documentation Issues
Construct 3's official tutorials and docs suggest 3D model import is possible, but:
- The isometric city tutorial doesn't mention addon deprecation
- Addon marketplace lists 3DObject but blocks installation
- No warning during purchase that 3D model import is unsupported

### Actions Taken
1. Searched entire addon marketplace for alternatives (none found)
2. Researched workarounds (all compromise core functionality)
3. Documented issue thoroughly
4. Submitted refund request to Scirra (same day as purchase)

### Refund Justification
- Purchase made today (October 25, 2025)
- Critical feature unavailable in current version
- Discovered within hours of purchase
- No projects completed using Construct 3
- Documentation misleading about capabilities
- $168 is significant investment for K-5 educator

### Lessons Learned
- Visual editors have black-box limitations you discover too late
- "3D support" doesn't always mean "3D model import"
- Research addon compatibility, not just features list
- Visual editors are great for 2D, risky for 3D
- Subscription model means ongoing costs if stuck with tool

**Decision:** Requested refund, sought alternative 3D-capable tool

---

## Attempt 3: GDevelop (Free Visual Game Editor)

**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Cost:** $0 (free tier)  
**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS → ABANDONED

### Why We Tried GDevelop
- Free (no financial risk after Construct 3 failure)
- Web-based editor (no install required)
- Native 3D Model object support
- Built-in AI assistant (could speed up development)

### "AI Inception" Approach
Instead of manual clicking, we used GDevelop's built-in AI agent:
- User prompts me (GitHub Copilot)
- I generate prompts for GDevelop AI
- User relays prompts to GDevelop
- GDevelop AI creates project structure

### What We Accomplished (Under 5 Minutes!)
GDevelop AI successfully created:
1. ✅ **3D Project Structure:** Started from "starting-3d-tile-placement" template
2. ✅ **Garage Object:** 3D Model type, positioned at (0,0,0)
3. ✅ **Smooth Camera:** 3D Box with Third Person Camera behavior
   - Distance: 1000 units
   - Elevation: 45 degrees
   - Follows Garage object
4. ✅ **Mouse Controls:** Right-click + drag for orbital rotation
5. ✅ **Scene Variables:** PreviousMouseX for rotation tracking
6. ✅ **Ground Plane:** Background color object as base layer
7. ✅ **HTML5 Export:** Confirmed compatibility

**Time to setup:** ~5 minutes (vs. 20+ hours with Three.js)

### GLB Import Success (Sort Of)
1. Located Kenney assets: `C:\Users\scoso\WEBSITES\Mrsomersmaps\assets\City Assets\kenney-city-builder\models\building-garage.glb`
2. Successfully imported GLB file into Garage object
3. Model geometry rendered correctly ✅
4. Model scale was correct ✅

### Critical Issue: Texture Loading Failed
**Problem:** Model renders as flat purple/blue color instead of textured

#### Symptoms
- Geometry visible and properly scaled
- No textures displayed (gray/purple overlay)
- Model recognizable by shape but missing colors/materials
- Kenney garage should be tan/beige with red/brown roof

#### Troubleshooting Attempted
1. ✅ Checked Material setting: "KeepOriginal" (should preserve GLB textures)
2. ✅ Verified GLB file has embedded textures (Godot project confirms this)
3. ✅ Checked Shadow casting/receiving settings
4. ⚠️ GDevelop AI assistant stopped responding (ran out of free requests)
5. ⚠️ Limited to manual troubleshooting

#### Possible Causes
- Missing lighting (model needs light source to see textures)
- Texture loading disabled in 3D Model object settings
- Shader/material settings need adjustment
- GLB embedded textures not being read by GDevelop
- Godot-specific texture format incompatibility

#### What We Didn't Try (Ran Out of Time)
- Add directional or ambient light to scene
- Change material settings beyond "KeepOriginal"
- Adjust scene background color (might be interfering)
- Export and test in HTML5 (preview only)
- Test with different GLB file (simpler model)

### Why We Abandoned GDevelop
1. **Ran out of free AI requests:** Can't use AI assistant anymore
2. **Texture issue unsolved:** Model renders but not usable without colors
3. **Manual troubleshooting slow:** Visual editor requires lots of clicking
4. **Time investment risk:** Could spend hours fixing texture loading
5. **Same 3D complexity:** Still fighting 3D rendering issues

### Key Insight: The Real Problem
**It's not the tools—it's 3D itself.**

All three attempts (Three.js, Construct 3, GDevelop) hit 3D-specific issues:
- Model/texture loading pipelines
- Lighting requirements
- Camera controls complexity
- Performance considerations
- Asset format compatibility

### Lessons Learned
- GDevelop's AI assistant is powerful (created project in 5 min)
- Visual editors can work quickly... until they don't
- 3D rendering is complex across ALL platforms
- Free tier limitations block progress at critical moments
- Fighting rendering bugs > building game mechanics

**Decision:** Pivot from 3D to 2D, abandon visual editors

## Pivot Decision: Custom 2D JavaScript Code

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Rationale:** After 3 failed 3D attempts, pivoting to 2D with custom code

### Why 2D Instead of 3D?

#### The Brutal Truth About 3D for K-5 Educational Games
1. **Complexity Tax:** Every 3D engine (Three.js, Construct 3, GDevelop) hit rendering issues
2. **Student UX:** Kids don't need rotating cameras—they need clear visuals
3. **Device Performance:** School Chromebooks struggle with 3D (2D is smooth)
4. **Development Time:** 3D debugging = days/weeks, 2D implementation = hours/days
5. **Visual Clarity:** 2D isometric view shows everything clearly (no camera confusion)

#### Proven 2D Success Stories
Games that "look 3D" but use 2D:
- **SimCity (classic):** Grid-based isometric city builder
- **Stardew Valley:** Feels 3D, is 2D sprites
- **Roller Coaster Tycoon:** Complex city simulation, all 2D
- **Habbo Hotel:** Virtual world building, pure 2D

**Key insight:** Students care about gameplay and clarity, not graphics technology

### Why Custom Code Instead of Visual Editors?

#### What We Lose With Visual Editors (Construct 3, GDevelop)
1. **Black Box Problems:** When something breaks, you're stuck
2. **Limited by Tool:** Can't do anything the editor doesn't support
3. **Subscription Costs:** Ongoing fees if you need premium features
4. **Export Limitations:** Some tools limit HTML5 export or add branding
5. **AI Guidance Only:** I can tell you what to click, but can't fix it directly

#### What We Gain With Custom Code
1. **Full Control:** Every line of code is visible and modifiable
2. **Zero Costs:** HTML5/JavaScript/Canvas = free forever
3. **Direct Integration:** Supabase authentication and cloud save (I code it)
4. **AI Can Code:** I write actual JavaScript instead of guiding UI clicks
5. **Debuggable:** Console logs, breakpoints, full visibility
6. **Educational:** You can learn from the code or hire someone to modify it later

   - Mitigation: Test one sprite first, then batch load
   - Fallback: Use colored rectangles temporarily

3. **Performance on Chromebooks**
   - Risk: Canvas rendering too slow
   - Mitigation: Start small (10×10 grid), optimize later
   - Fallback: Reduce grid size, limit buildings

4. **Save/Load Corruption**
   - Risk: City state doesn't restore correctly
   - Mitigation: JSON serialization with validation
   - Fallback: Manual city reset button

5. **AI Coding Errors**
   - Risk: I write buggy code
   - Mitigation: Test each feature incrementally
   - Fallback: User reviews code, I fix bugs

**Overall Risk Level:** LOW (2D canvas is proven, stable technology)

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **3D Is Hard Everywhere**
   - Not just Three.js—ALL 3D engines have steep learning curves
   - Model/texture pipelines are complex across platforms
   - Lighting, materials, shaders add layers of complexity
   - "Import GLB" sounds simple, rarely is

2. **Visual Editors Have Hidden Limits**
   - Black boxes hide problems until you hit them
   - Addon/plugin ecosystems can break without warning
   - "Supports 3D" ≠ "Supports 3D model import"
   - Free tiers block progress at critical moments

3. **2D Is Underrated**
   - Modern 2D games look great (Stardew Valley, Celeste, Hollow Knight)
   - Canvas API is mature, stable, performant
   - Proven approach for educational games
   - Students care about gameplay, not graphics tech

4. **Custom Code Wins for Custom Needs**
   - If you need Supabase integration, code it directly
   - If you need specific features, build them yourself
   - If AI can code, use that advantage
   - Zero cost > subscription models for educators

### Project Management Lessons

1. **Prototype Before Purchasing**
   - Test critical features BEFORE buying licenses
   - Use free trials to verify compatibility
   - Read addon reviews for deprecation warnings

2. **Time-Box Experiments**
   - If approach doesn't work in X hours, pivot
   - Don't fall for sunk cost fallacy
   - Three.js: Should have quit after 5 hours, not 20

3. **Document Everything**
   - This file captures entire journey
   - Future self will thank you
   - Helps explain decisions to stakeholders

4. **Know When to Pivot**
   - 3 failed attempts = pattern, not bad luck
   - Sometimes the approach is wrong, not the execution
   - Pivoting early saves time vs. pushing forward

### Educational Game Design Lessons

1. **Target Audience Constraints Matter**
   - K-5 students use school Chromebooks (limited hardware)
   - Teachers need simple deployment (web-based = best)
   - School networks block some tech (3D models = suspicious)

2. **Gameplay > Graphics**
   - Students engage with fun mechanics, not fancy visuals
   - Clear UI > realistic rendering
   - Responsive controls > cinematic cameras

3. **Budget Reality for Educators**
   - $168 is significant for teacher-funded projects
   - Free tools are necessary, not optional
   - Subscription costs compound over years
