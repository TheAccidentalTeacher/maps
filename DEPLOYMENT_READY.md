# 🚀 Deployment Ready - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Fixed Today

Your local dev server (`localhost:8888`) is now working perfectly with:

1. **✅ AI-Powered Photo Matching** - Claude reads facts and matches them to relevant photos
   - Bridge facts → bridge photos
   - Wildlife facts → animal photos  
   - NO MORE random dogs for turtle facts! 🐕❌🐢

2. **✅ Location Disambiguation** - Photos search with country context
   - "Palmyra Maine" gets small town photos
   - "Palmyra Syria" gets ancient ruins photos
   - NO MORE confusion between same-named places!

3. **✅ Geography in Real Life Card** - Educational real-world applications
   - Scrollable content
   - Student-safe with ironclad filters
   - Uses 5 Themes of Geography

## 🎯 Deploy to Production (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables
```powershell
.\check-environment-vars.ps1
```
This verifies your API keys are ready. You'll need to add them to Netlify dashboard.

### Step 2: Deploy Your Code
```powershell
.\deploy-to-netlify.ps1
```
This commits and pushes your changes to GitHub. Netlify auto-deploys.

### Step 3: Test Production Site
```powershell
.\test-production.ps1
```
This runs automated tests and guides you through manual verification.

---

## 📋 Or Do It Manually

### Deploy:
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "AI photo matching + location disambiguation"
git push origin main
```

### Monitor Deploy:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Click your site
3. Watch "Deploys" tab (takes 1-3 minutes)

### Test:
1. Open your live site in incognito mode
2. Click Greenville, South Carolina
3. Verify photos match facts (bridge → bridge, turtle → wildlife)

---

## 🔑 Critical: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

**Go to:** Netlify Dashboard → Site configuration → Environment variables

**Add these 6 keys:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude 3.5 (CRITICAL - AI matching won't work without this!)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - GPT-4o (fallback)
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - Flux Schnell (image generation fallback)
- `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` - Photos (CRITICAL)
- `PEXELS_API_KEY` - Photos (secondary)
- `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` - Weather

**⚠️ WITHOUT THESE, YOUR PRODUCTION SITE WON'T WORK!**

---

## 🧪 Testing Locations

Test these 3 locations after deployment:

### 1. Greenville, South Carolina ✅
- **Why:** Multiple diverse facts (bridge, wildlife, geography)
- **Check:** Liberty Bridge fact → bridge photo (not a plant!)
- **Check:** Eastern Box Turtle fact → wildlife photo (not a dog!)

### 2. Palmyra, Maine ✅
- **Why:** Tests location disambiguation
- **Check:** Photos show small town Maine (not Syrian archaeological site)

### 3. Alaska Location (Your Students) ✅
- **Why:** Your actual use case
- **Check:** All facts have photos
- **Check:** Geography in Real Life card is relatable for Alaska students

## 📁 Files You Need

All ready to deploy:

### Netlify Functions (Production):
- ✅ `netlify/functions/match-photos-to-facts.js` - AI photo matching with country disambiguation
- ✅ `netlify/functions/generate-real-life-geography.js` - Safe educational content
- ✅ `netlify/functions/get-ai-facts.js` - Generate facts
- ✅ `netlify/functions/get-photos.js` - Fetch photos
- ✅ `netlify/functions/get-weather.js` - Weather data

### Local Dev Server:
- ✅ `local-dev-server.js` - Matches Netlify behavior exactly

### Main App:
- ✅ `index.html` - With Geography in Real Life card, scrolling fixes

### Configuration:
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify settings

---

## 🚨 If Production Doesn't Work

### Issue: Photos Are Random/Wrong
**Cause:** Environment variables not set  
**Fix:** Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to Netlify dashboard

### Issue: Functions Return 500 Errors
**Cause:** Missing API keys  
**Fix:** Check Netlify function logs for specific missing key, add it to environment variables

### Issue: Still Seeing Old Version
**Cause:** Browser cache  
**Fix:** Open in incognito mode OR hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Netlify Deploy Failed
**Cause:** Build errors  
**Fix:** Check deploy logs in Netlify dashboard → Deploys → [failed deploy] → Deploy log

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

You'll know production is working when:

- ✅ All facts have REAL photos (not AI-generated infographics)
- ✅ Photos are contextually relevant (turtle fact = turtle photo)
- ✅ No location confusion (Maine ≠ Syria)
- ✅ Geography in Real Life card appears and scrolls
- ✅ Content is student-appropriate (safety filters working)
- ✅ Browser console shows no red errors

---

## 🎓 Student Readiness

Your site is ready for 15 Alaska middle schoolers when:

1. ✅ All automated tests pass
2. ✅ You've tested 3+ locations successfully
3. ✅ Photos are educational and accurate
4. ✅ Geography in Real Life examples are relatable
5. ✅ No inappropriate content appears
6. ✅ Everything loads in under 5 seconds

## 📞 Need Help?

### Quick Diagnostics:
```powershell
# Check local environment
.\check-environment-vars.ps1

# Test production site
.\test-production.ps1
```

### Check These:
1. **Netlify Function Logs** - Real-time errors from production
2. **Browser Console (F12)** - Client-side JavaScript errors
3. **Network Tab** - Failed API calls (401 = missing keys, 500 = server error)

### Common Fixes:
- Missing photos → Add `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to Netlify
- Random photo matching → Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to Netlify
- Geography card not showing → Check if `generate-real-life-geography.js` deployed
- Timeout errors → Check if API keys are valid (not expired)
