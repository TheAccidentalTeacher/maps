## 🗺️ Project Origin Story

Math Detective Academy is **adapted from Geographic Detective Academy**, a successful map-based geography learning game. We're transforming the geography app into a math app by:

- Replacing the Leaflet.js world map → Chart.js coordinate plane
- Adapting geography game modes → Math learning activities
- Keeping the proven core systems intact (achievements, AI, safety)
- Updating visual theme from blue/green → purple/orange

**Why this approach?**
- Proven educational platform (Geography app is 85% complete, 9,283 lines)
- Tested with students and teachers
- Robust achievement and safety systems already built
- Focus on math content, not rebuilding infrastructure
