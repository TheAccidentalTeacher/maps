# Math City Builder - Economy Design

**Purpose:** Complete documentation of the dollar-based economy system  
**Philosophy:** Real-world financial literacy through gameplay  
**Goal:** Build toward "Million Dollar City" through progressive math mastery  

---

## Economic Philosophy

### Why Dollars Instead of Coins?

**Educational Benefits:**
1. **Real-world connection:** Students understand dollars from daily life
2. **Financial literacy:** Learn about money management, budgeting, saving
3. **Scalability:** $10 to $1,000,000 feels natural (5 coins to 500,000 coins doesn't)
4. **Math reinforcement:** Working with large numbers builds number sense
5. **Future-proof:** Can add concepts like loans, interest, investments later

**Gameplay Benefits:**
1. **Clear progression:** $10 house → $100,000 tower feels epic
2. **Meaningful milestones:** $1K, $10K, $100K, $1M achievements
3. **Strategic depth:** Save for big building or buy many small ones?
4. **Motivation:** "I need $50,000 for the university!" is a clear goal

## Currency Scale & Progression

### Dollar Earning Rates

**Base earning rate:** $10 per correct answer (Multiplication 1-12)

**Scaling by math difficulty:**
```
Elementary Level:
- Single Digit Addition:     $8/problem
- Basic Subtraction:          $8/problem
- Multiplication 1-12:       $10/problem
- Basic Division:            $12/problem

Middle School Level:
- Double Digit Addition:     $15/problem
- 2-Digit × 1-Digit:         $25/problem
- 2-Digit × 2-Digit:         $50/problem
- Basic Fractions:           $40/problem

High School Level:
- Algebra (Linear):         $100/problem
- Geometry (Area):          $100/problem

Advanced Level:
- Geometry Proofs:          $500/problem
```

**Why this matters:**
- Elementary student: 1 problem = $10 → $50 house (5 problems, ~2 minutes)
- High school student: 1 proof = $500 → $50,000 university (100 proofs, ~1 hour)
- Fair time investment across grade levels

## City Value Calculation

### What is "City Value"?

**City Value** = Sum of all building values placed in the city

**Why value > cost?**
- Reward investment: Buying $10,000 building increases city value by $15,000
- Encourage diversity: Different buildings have different value multipliers
- Financial lesson: Assets appreciate, good investments grow wealth

### Value Multipliers by Building Type

```javascript
// Residential: 1.0-1.3x multiplier
'small-house': { cost: 10, value: 10 },      // 1.0x
'medium-house': { cost: 100, value: 125 },   // 1.25x
'apartment': { cost: 300, value: 400 },      // 1.33x

// Commercial: 1.2-1.4x multiplier
'shop': { cost: 25, value: 30 },             // 1.2x
'mall': { cost: 2000, value: 2500 },         // 1.25x
'office': { cost: 500, value: 650 },         // 1.3x

// Civic/Educational: 1.3-1.5x multiplier (highest!)
'school': { cost: 3000, value: 4000 },       // 1.33x
'library': { cost: 4000, value: 5000 },      // 1.25x
'university': { cost: 50000, value: 75000 }, // 1.5x
'museum': { cost: 75000, value: 100000 },    // 1.33x

// Ultimate: 1.5x multiplier
'ultimate-tower': { cost: 100000, value: 150000 } // 1.5x
```

**Strategic Depth:** Students learn that educational buildings are the best long-term investments (highest value multiplier).

## Earning vs. Spending Balance

### Economic Pacing

**Early Game (Tier 1-2):**
- Earn: Fast ($10/problem, 1 minute per problem)
- Spend: Fast ($10-$200 buildings)
- Result: Constant building, immediate satisfaction
- Goal: Hook students, teach mechanics

**Mid Game (Tier 3-4):**
- Earn: Moderate (still $10-$25/problem for most)
- Spend: Significant ($300-$5,000 buildings)
- Result: Planning required, budgeting matters
- Goal: Strategic thinking, goal setting

**Late Game (Tier 5):**
- Earn: Variable (could be $10 or $500 depending on math type)
- Spend: Major ($10,000-$100,000 buildings)
- Result: Long-term planning, high motivation
- Goal: Mastery demonstration, epic achievement

### Bankruptcy Prevention

**Can students ever run out of money?**

**NO!** Design prevents bankruptcy:

1. **Always can earn more:** "Earn Dollars" button always available
2. **No negative balances:** Can't place building without sufficient funds
3. **Demolish refund:** Can demolish buildings for 50% refund if needed
4. **Starting funds:** Begin with $100 (enough for 2-3 starter homes)

**Lesson:** You can always recover through hard work (math practice).

## Revenue Diversification Strategy

### Multiple Math Types = Multiple Income Streams

**Elementary Student Path:**
- Start: Multiplication ($10/problem)
- Add: Addition ($8/problem) for variety
- Add: Division ($12/problem) when ready
- Result: $10-$12 average per problem

**Middle School Path:**
- Primary: 2×1 Multiplication ($25/problem)
- Supplement: Fractions ($40/problem)
- Result: $25-$40 average per problem

**High School Path:**
- Primary: Algebra ($100/problem)
- Primary: Geometry area ($100/problem)
- Advanced: Geometry proofs ($500/problem)
- Result: $100-$500 per problem

**Strategic Depth:** Students can optimize earnings by choosing harder math, or stay comfortable with familiar problems. Both approaches work!

## Economic Balancing

### How We Determined These Values

**Starting Point:** 
- Question: "How many problems should a $50,000 building require?"
- Answer: Depends on grade level and problem difficulty

**Elementary Balance:**
- $50,000 ÷ $10 = 5,000 problems
- At 2 minutes/problem = 167 hours
- Too long! Need high school path to be faster

**High School Balance:**
- $50,000 ÷ $500 = 100 problems
- At 3 minutes/problem = 5 hours
- Perfect! Challenging but achievable

**Result:** Multi-tier economy where:
- Elementary: Focus on Tier 1-3 buildings (achievable in weeks)
- Middle School: Focus on Tier 3-4 buildings (achievable in weeks)
- High School: Can reach Tier 5 buildings (achievable in days/weeks)

### Playtesting Targets

**Session Length:** 15-30 minutes (typical school period or homework session)

**What Should Happen in One Session:**

**Elementary Student (Multiplication @$10):**
- Earn: ~$100-$150 (10-15 problems)
- Buy: 2-3 Tier 1 buildings OR save for 1 Tier 2
- Progress: Visible city growth, satisfying

**Middle School Student (2×1 Mult @$25):**
- Earn: ~$250-$400 (10-15 problems)
- Buy: 1-2 Tier 2 buildings OR save for Tier 3
- Progress: Steady city development

**High School Student (Proofs @$500):**
- Earn: ~$2,500-$5,000 (5-10 problems)
- Buy: 1 Tier 4 building OR save for Tier 5
- Progress: Major city transformation

**All students feel productive in 20 minutes of play!**

|------|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | $10-$50 | 10 | $320 | $320 |
| 2 | $75-$200 | 10 | $1,425 | $1,745 |
| 3 | $300-$1,000 | 10 | $5,500 | $7,245 |
| 4 | $1,500-$5,000 | 10 | $32,500 | $39,745 |
| 5 | $10,000-$100,000 | 10 | $475,000 | $514,745 |

**To buy every building:** $514,745  
**At $10/problem:** 51,475 problems (~1,716 hours)  
**At $500/problem:** 1,030 problems (~52 hours)  

**Realistic Goal:** Students don't need every building. $100K city (milestone 3) is more realistic endgame for elementary students.

### Time Investment Estimates

| Student Level | Primary Math Type | Earnings Rate | $50K Building Time | $1M City Time |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Elementary | Multiplication | $10/problem | 167 hours | 3,333 hours |
| Middle School | 2×2 Multiplication | $50/problem | 33 hours | 667 hours |
| High School | Algebra | $100/problem | 17 hours | 333 hours |
| High School | Geometry Proofs | $500/problem | 3.3 hours | 67 hours |

**Key Insight:** Game scales naturally to student level. All paths are challenging but achievable!

## Economic Lessons Embedded in Gameplay

### What Students Learn Without Realizing

1. **Budgeting:** "I have $150. Do I buy 3 small houses or save for the $200 office?"
2. **Delayed gratification:** "I'll skip this $50 house and save for the $3,000 school"
3. **Investment ROI:** "Educational buildings have best value multiplier"
4. **Compound growth:** "City value milestones give bonuses that accelerate progress"
5. **Diversification:** "Mixing building types increases total city value"
6. **Risk vs. reward:** "Harder math problems pay more but take longer to solve"
7. **Resource management:** "Should I demolish this house to fund a hospital?"
8. **Long-term planning:** "Path to $1M requires consistent effort over time"
