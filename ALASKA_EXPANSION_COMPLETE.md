**Date Completed:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING

## üéØ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

  - Preview of next round
  - "Start Next Round" button

#### 5. **Enhanced UI Feedback**

## üìù CODE CHANGES MADE

### 1. Data Structure (`alaskaRounds` array - Lines 1257-1370)
Replaced simple `alaskaLocations` array with structured `alaskaRounds`:
```javascript
const alaskaRounds = [
    {
        name: "Round 1: Home Territory",
        description: "Explore the Copper River Basin...",
        locations: [ /* 10 locations with clue, fact, type */ ]
    },
    // ... 4 more rounds
];
```

### 2. Game State (Lines 1267-1273)
Updated to track rounds and progress:
```javascript
alaska: {
    currentRound: 0,
    roundProgress: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    totalFound: 0,
    active: false,
    foundLocations: [] // e.g., ["r0_1", "r0_5", "r1_3"]
}
```

### 3. Game Functions (Lines 1853-2090)
Completely rewrote core game logic:
- ‚úÖ `startAlaskaGame()` - Initializes round system
- ‚úÖ `updateAlaskaDisplay()` - Shows current round, clues, progress
- ‚úÖ `checkAlaskaLocation()` - Validates clicks, handles round completion
- ‚úÖ `checkAlaskaAchievements()` - Counts across all rounds
- ‚úÖ `resetAlaska()` - Clears all round data
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** `showRoundComplete()` - Celebration screen
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** `showGameComplete()` - Grand finale screen
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** `startNextRound()` - Advances to next round

### 4. Tutorial Update (Lines 2200-2236)
Updated Alaska tutorial to explain:
- 5-round structure with themes
- Geographical clue system
- New achievement requirements
- XP rewards (30 per location, 100 per round, 500 grand prize)

## üêõ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

### Known Considerations
1. **localStorage Compatibility**: If student's old save data has the old format, it may cause errors
   - **Solution**: First-time players will be fine. If issues occur, they can reset via browser console: `localStorage.clear()`

2. **50-Mile Tolerance**: Some locations are close together
   - **Watch for**: Students accidentally finding wrong location
   - **Current behavior**: Shows closest location hint if wrong

3. **Round Lock**: Students MUST complete Round 1 before Round 2, etc.
   - **By design**: Educational progression
   - **Watch for**: Student frustration if they can't skip

4. **Achievement Timing**: Badges check after every location found
   - **Watch for**: Animation lag if checking 50+ locations repeatedly
   - **Current mitigation**: Efficient filtering with early returns

## üìä EDUCATIONAL VALUE IMPROVEMENTS

### Before (10 locations)
- Simple scavenger hunt
- Minimal learning value
- No progression structure
- 20-30 minutes of gameplay
- Low replayability

### After (50 locations)  
- **Structured Learning Path**: 5 themed rounds teach different aspects of Alaska
- **Geographical Literacy**: Clues teach students to read landscape features
- **Cultural Context**: Historic sites round teaches Alaska's heritage
- **Extended Engagement**: 2-3 hours of rich content
- **Achievement Motivation**: Clear milestones keep students engaged
- **Research Skills**: Students may need to look up geographical terms

---

## üí° TEACHER TALKING POINTS

### When Introducing to Students:
1. **"This is a 5-part journey through Alaska"**
   - Emphasize progression and mastery
   
2. **"Read the clues carefully - they're teaching you geography vocabulary"**
   - Encourage critical thinking
   
3. **"You can take breaks between rounds"**
   - Progress is saved automatically
   
4. **"Try to complete without looking things up first, but research is allowed!"**
   - Balance challenge with learning

### Assessment Opportunities:
- Have students explain HOW they found specific locations
- Ask students to describe geographical features in their own words
- Compare student completion times (who has best geographical intuition?)
- Discussion: "Which round was hardest? Why?"

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Test in browser at http://localhost:8000
2. ‚úÖ Play through at least Round 1 completely
3. ‚úÖ Verify achievement badges unlock
4. ‚úÖ Check console for any JavaScript errors

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Have 1-2 students beta test with teacher supervision
2. Gather feedback on:
   - Are clues too hard or too easy?
   - Is 50 miles tolerance appropriate?
   - Are students reading the facts?
   - Do achievement thresholds feel achievable?

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. Adjust difficulty based on feedback
2. Consider adding:
   - Hint button that shows region/area
   - "Skip location" option (with penalty?)
   - Leaderboard for fastest completions
3. Deploy to production (GitHub Pages)

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### How to Know It's Working:
- ‚úÖ Students complete multiple rounds (not just Round 1)
- ‚úÖ Students reference the geographical clues in conversation
- ‚úÖ Achievement badges motivate continued play
- ‚úÖ Students report learning new things about Alaska
- ‚úÖ Completion rates improve over time (getting better at geography)

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- ‚ùå Students quit after Round 1 (too hard?)
- ‚ùå Students randomly clicking without reading clues (not engaging)
- ‚ùå High frustration with tolerance distance (too strict?)
- ‚ùå No one completing all 5 rounds (too long?)
