## 🎯 Achievement Tracking System

### Prevents Duplicate Unlocks

**Before (Problem):**
```javascript
// Achievements could unlock multiple times
if (mountains >= 5) {
    badges[0].classList.add('unlocked');
    addXP(100); // Would give XP every time function runs!
}
```

**After (Solution):**
```javascript
// Track what's been unlocked
if (!gameState.alaska.achievements) {
    gameState.alaska.achievements = {
        mountainMaster: false,
        riverRunner: false,
        parkExplorer: false,
        cityFinder: false,
        alaskaExpert: false
    };
}

// Only unlock once
if (mountains >= 5 && !gameState.alaska.achievements.mountainMaster) {
    gameState.alaska.achievements.mountainMaster = true;
    unlockAchievement(badges[0], '⛰️ MOUNTAIN MASTER', 'Found 5 mountains!', 100);
}
```

### Persistent State
- Achievement status saved to localStorage
- Survives page refreshes
- Students keep their progress
- Badges stay unlocked across sessions

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### New Functions Created

#### 1. `unlockAchievement(badge, title, description, xpReward)`

- `description` - What student accomplished
- `xpReward` - XP amount to award

**Process:**
1. Removes 'locked' class from badge
2. Adds 'unlocked' class (triggers CSS animation)
3. Awards XP via `addXP()`
4. Waits 0.5 seconds
5. Shows full-screen celebration

#### 2. `showAchievementUnlock(title, description, xpReward)`
**Purpose:** Creates and displays the celebration overlay  
**Features:**
- Generates full-screen overlay with animations
- Injects custom CSS keyframes for effects
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Adds "Awesome!" button for manual dismissal

#### 3. `closeAchievementOverlay()`
**Purpose:** Dismisses the celebration overlay smoothly  
**Features:**
- Adds fade-out animation
- Removes overlay after 0.3 seconds
- Can be called by button or auto-timer

### Enhanced Functions

#### `checkAlaskaAchievements()` - Major Enhancement
**Added:**
- Achievement tracking initialization

- Calls to `unlockAchievement()` with proper parameters
- Still updates badges for already-unlocked achievements

**Before (23 lines):**

if (mountains >= 5) {
    badges[0].classList.add('unlocked');
}
```

**After (85+ lines):**
```javascript
if (mountains >= 5 && !gameState.alaska.achievements.mountainMaster) {
    gameState.alaska.achievements.mountainMaster = true;
    unlockAchievement(badges[0], '⛰️ MOUNTAIN MASTER', 'Found 5 mountains!', 100);
} else if (mountains >= 5) {
    badges[0].classList.remove('locked');
    badges[0].classList.add('unlocked');
}
```
