## ✅ WORKING FEATURES (60% Complete)

### 1. Game Engine ✅
```javascript
// game.js - Complete game state management
const gameState = {
    dollars: 100,              // Starting money
    xp: 0,                     // Experience points
    level: 1,                  // Player level
    cityValue: 0,              // Total city worth
    selectedBuilding: null,    // Current building to place
    placedBuildings: [],       // All placed buildings
    demolishMode: false,       // Demolish toggle
    correctAnswers: 0,         // Quiz stats
    wrongAnswers: 0,
    streak: 0
};
```

### 2. 2D Sprite Rendering System ✅
```javascript
// canvas.js - Lines 100-110
ctx.drawImage(
    img,
    screenPos.x - spriteWidth / 2,
    screenPos.y - spriteHeight + 40,
    spriteWidth,
    spriteHeight
);
```
- **Image Caching:** Loads sprites once, reuses them
- **Fallback System:** Shows isometric placeholders while loading
- **Path:** `../assets/math-city-builder/buildings/tier{X}/{sprite}.png`

### 3. Building System ✅
- **5 Tiers:** Starter ($10-50) → Metropolis ($10K-100K)
- **Cost/Income:** Each building has purchase cost and income per quiz
- **Unlock Logic:** Buildings unlock based on city value
- **Placement:** Click building in sidebar → Click canvas to place
- **Demolish Mode:** 50% refund on demolition

### 4. Math Quiz System ✅
```javascript
// 10 Different Math Types:
- Elementary: Multiplication 1-12, Addition, Subtraction
- Middle School: Double digit addition, Division
- Advanced: 2×1 Mult, 2×2 Mult, Fractions
- High School: Algebra, Geometry
- BOSS MODE: Two-Column Proofs ($500 per quiz!)
```

### 5. Progression System ✅
- **XP System:** 100 XP = 1 level
- **Level Up Bonuses:** Level × $50 bonus
- **4 Milestones:**
  - $1,000 = $100 bonus (🥉 Bronze)
  - $10,000 = $1,000 bonus (🥈 Silver)
  - $100,000 = $10,000 bonus (🥇 Gold)
  - $1,000,000 = DIAMOND WIN! 💎

### 6. Canvas Controls ✅
- **Zoom:** 0.5× to 2.0× (buttons + mouse wheel)
- **Pan:** Camera movement
- **Reset View:** Center and reset zoom
- **Isometric Grid:** Rendered with proper perspective

### 7. Save/Load System ✅
- **localStorage:** Saves game state locally
- **Auto-save:** (Need to verify timing)
- **Reset Game:** With confirmation modal

## ⚠️ INCOMPLETE FEATURES (40% Remaining)

### 🚨 BLOCKER #1: Sprite Assets
**Problem:** Code expects PNG sprites, but we have GLB models

**Current Path (Broken):**
```
../assets/math-city-builder/buildings/tier1/house-small.png
```

**What We Actually Have:**
```
assets/city-builder/kenney-city/garage-large.glb
assets/city-builder/kenney-city/house-type01.glb
... (200+ GLB files)
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Convert GLB → PNG** (4 hours with Blender batch export)
2. **Use Emoji/Placeholder Sprites** (2 hours - temporary solution)
3. **Find 2D Sprite Sheets** (3 hours - search OpenGameArt.org)

### 🚨 BLOCKER #2: Quiz Modal
**Status:** Partial - Button exists, calls `showQuizModal()`

**Need to verify:**
- [ ] Modal HTML exists in index.html
- [ ] Math generation works
- [ ] Answer checking logic
- [ ] Reward payout system

### 🚨 BLOCKER #3: Building Placement
**Status:** Partial - Logic exists, needs testing

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Click detection on canvas
- ✅ Grid coordinate conversion
- ✅ Screen-to-grid and grid-to-screen functions

**Need to test:**
- [ ] Building placement works
- [ ] Collision detection (can't overlap)
- [ ] Money deduction on purchase
- [ ] City value updates

### Minor Issues:
- [ ] Supabase integration (currently uses localStorage only)
- [ ] Cloud save/sync
- [ ] Multi-device support
- [ ] Teacher dashboard integration

## 🎯 TO FINISH (8-12 Hours)

### Priority 1: Get Sprites Working (4 hours)
**Fastest Path:** Use emoji placeholders
```javascript
// Quick fix in canvas.js
const emojiSprites = {
    tier1: '🏠',
    tier2: '🏢',
    tier3: '🏭',
    tier4: '🌆',
    tier5: '🗼'
};
// Render emoji instead of images
ctx.font = '64px Arial';
ctx.fillText(emojiSprites[building.tier], screenPos.x, screenPos.y);
```

### Priority 2: Test & Fix Quiz Modal (2 hours)
- [ ] Open game at http://localhost:8000/math-city-builder/
- [ ] Click "Earn Dollars" button
- [ ] Verify modal appears
- [ ] Test math generation
- [ ] Test answer validation
- [ ] Fix any bugs

### Priority 3: Test Building Placement (2 hours)
- [ ] Click building in sidebar
- [ ] Click canvas to place
- [ ] Verify money deduction
- [ ] Verify city value increases
- [ ] Test demolish mode

### Priority 4: Supabase Integration (4 hours)
- [ ] Copy auth code from old `math-city-builder.html`
- [ ] Add save/load to `city_progress` table
- [ ] Replace localStorage with Supabase
- [ ] Test cloud sync

```
math-city-builder/          ← THE ACTUAL GAME
├── index.html
├── css/game.css
└── js/*.js (all 6 files)
```

### ⚠️ ARCHIVE (Old Attempts):
```
math-city-builder.html      ← Three.js version (deprecated)
CONSTRUCT3_*.md            ← Construct 3 research (archived)
```

### ✅ KEEP (Documentation):
```
CITY_ASSETS_INVENTORY.md   ← 200+ Kenney GLB models
MATH_CITY_BUILDER_*.md     ← Design docs
GAME_ENGINE_EVALUATION_SUMMARY.md  ← History of attempts
```

## 🚀 Next Session Checklist

When you return to this project:

1. **Read this file first** - Don't trust old docs
2. **Open:** http://localhost:8000/math-city-builder/index.html
3. **Test what works** - Click around, try placing buildings
4. **Fix sprites** - Use emoji placeholders if needed
5. **Test quiz modal** - Make sure math problems appear
6. **Update progress** - Document what actually works

## 📞 Access Information

**Dev Server:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\scoso\WEBSITES\Mrsomersmaps
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Game URL:**
```
http://localhost:8000/math-city-builder/index.html
```

**Supabase Project:**
- URL: https://fuppbkhfqutzcromomkc.supabase.co
- Table: `city_progress`
- Auth: Working in old HTML file

---

## 💡 Key Lessons

1. **Document immediately** - Don't wait until next session
2. **Single source of truth** - One main implementation
3. **Test before claiming complete** - Verify features work
4. **Archive old attempts** - Don't delete, but mark clearly
5. **File naming matters** - `math-city-builder/` vs `math-city-builder.html` caused confusion

---

**Status Summary:** We have a 60% complete 2D Canvas game that needs sprites and testing. DON'T START OVER - just finish this version!
