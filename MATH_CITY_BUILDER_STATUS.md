## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP: Task 2.1 - Grid System

### What We Need to Build:

**Goal:** Create a 50×50 tile grid system that tracks which tiles are occupied by buildings.

**Technical Requirements:**
1. **Data Structure:**
   ```javascript
   const cityGrid = Array(50).fill(null).map(() => Array(50).fill(null));
   // Each cell contains: null (empty) or building object
   ```

2. **Coordinate System:**
   - Canvas: 800×600px (visible area)
   - Grid: 50×50 tiles
   - Tile size: 16px × 16px (800÷50 = 16)
   - Origin: Top-left (0,0)

3. **Functions Needed:**
   - `getTileAt(x, y)` → Returns building or null
   - `setTileAt(x, y, building)` → Places building
   - `clearTileAt(x, y)` → Removes building
   - `isTileOccupied(x, y)` → Boolean check
   - `canPlaceBuilding(x, y, width, height)` → Collision detection

4. **Canvas Integration:**
   - Convert mouse click (px) → Grid coordinates (tile)
   - Highlight selected tile on hover
   - Show valid/invalid placement zones

**Expected Output:**
- Click canvas → Console logs tile coordinates (e.g., "Tile 15, 23")
- Grid array updated when building placed
- Grid data saved to `cityData.buildings` array

**Files to Modify:**
- `math-city-builder.html` (add grid system after line ~450)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## 🔧 Debug Commands Available

In browser console (F12), type `mathCityDebug` to access:

```javascript
mathCityDebug.enable()           // Turn on debug logs
mathCityDebug.getState()         // View full app state
mathCityDebug.getCityData()      // View city data
mathCityDebug.addCash(1000)      // Add cash for testing
mathCityDebug.unlockAllTiers()   // Skip to tier 4
mathCityDebug.resetCity()        // Reset to $500
```
