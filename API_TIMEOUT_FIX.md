# üêõ API TIMEOUT FIX - Why AI Features Failed at School

## Problem Identified

Your API calls have **NO TIMEOUT HANDLING**. When network conditions are poor (like at schools with slow/filtered networks), the fetch requests hang indefinitely and never return data.

### Current Code Issues:
```javascript
// ‚ùå NO TIMEOUT - hangs forever on slow networks
const response = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/get-ai-facts?${params}`);
```

### What Happens at School:
1. Student clicks location
2. Browser sends API request to Netlify Functions
3. Network is slow or school firewall delays response
4. Fetch waits forever (no timeout)
5. Student sees loading spinner that never ends
6. No error message, no fallback data

## ‚úÖ The Fix: Add Timeout + Retry Logic

### Key Changes:
1. **Timeout wrapper** - Cancel requests after 30 seconds
2. **Retry logic** - Try 2 times before giving up
3. **Better error messages** - Tell students what went wrong
4. **Graceful fallback** - Show placeholder content instead of blank screen

---

## Implementation

See `fix-api-timeouts.js` for the complete solution that adds:
- `fetchWithTimeout()` utility function
- Automatic retry on network errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback data when APIs fail

This will make the app work reliably even on slow school networks! üöÄ
